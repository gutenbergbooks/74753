<div class="blockquot">

<p>I had intended dedicating this little book to Mr.
Henry B. Fuller, to whose friendship and criticism
I owe much; but finally I decided it were wiser to
refrain. The explanation of my change of mind is
contained in the paragraph which follows:</p>

<p>“In this part of the world,” wrote Mr. Fuller, not
long ago, “the bacillus dedicatory hardly survives
within us up to middle age, but there is no denying
that it is terribly active in most beginners, and
that the ingenuous gratitude of these gives their
established elders considerable cause for embarrassment.
Have I written a successful story?
Then I cast about for some well-known name,
‘higher up,’ with which to adorn thy fly-leaf and to
ease my overpowering sense of obligation. The
effort on the part of these various celebrities to
elude my homage is the liveliest side of the literary
game, and not the least instructive phase of
unwritten literary history.”</p>

<small>ENCHANTER’S NIGHTSHADE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Colonel, you ’diculous dog, you’re so hot
<i>now</i> you can hardly breathe. No; you needn’t
bark. It’s too warm to play any more.”</p>

<p>Buddie was sitting on the fallen, mossy trunk
of a cedar tree, just inside the edge of the
wood, throwing little sticks for her dog Colonel
to fetch. Being a young dog, Colonel wanted
to play all day long, and he could not understand
why Buddie should tire of throwing sticks
when <i>he</i> never wearied of recovering them.
So when she bent to tie her shoe-string he
assumed that another stick was coming, and,
yelping with delight, he crouched for the spring.</p>

<p>But Buddie, in bending over, had made a
discovery that put an end to playing with sticks,
for that day at least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“Oh, what pretty flowers!” she cried; and
she began to make a bouquet of some white
blossoms that grew among the mosses of the
fallen cedar.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_006.jpg" alt="strange flower"></div>

<p>Before you learn about this strange flower,
Little One, I must tell you something of the
small person who found it, and of the wood in
which it grew.</p>

<p>“Buddie” was her every-day name. It is
short and easy to say, especially if one is in a
hurry, as Buddie’s mother always was. On
Sundays her name was Ethel Elvira, which
quite became a dress with a great deal of starch,
a sash with a great deal of rustle and new shoes
with a great deal of squeak.</p>

<p>Her home was a log house in the wild Northland,
just where the pine-trees came down to
peep into the mirror of a great lake. It was a
lonely shore and not at all the kind that you,
Little One, would like, for there was no sandy
beach to dig in. Here and there were short
stretches of gravel, but mostly it was black rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
and deep water, which the sun never succeeded
in warming. As far as one could see up and
down the lake there was no other house, and
the only blur on the wide sweep of dark blue
water was the tattered sail of a restless Indian
or the trailing smoke of a distant steamer.</p>

<p>In all the country round about there was
only one road, and this kept so close to the
lake—for fear, very likely, it would get lost—that
there was just room between it and the
water for the log house and a small back yard
for the chickens. Across the road was a cleared
space, sloping up over a little hill, in which
grew potatoes, turnips and other vegetables that
could stand a cold climate; for Buddie’s home
was so far north that real winter lasted six
months, and sometimes longer. There wasn’t
any spring to speak of—without complaining—and
nobody could tell when summer ended and
autumn began.</p>

<p>Buddie had two brothers younger than herself.
One was a wee tot who slept in a hammock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
near the kitchen stove, where the mother
could keep the pot a-boiling and the cradle
a-swinging at the same time; the other usually
spent his time “helping father” to improve the
road, which was in a sad way, or to hunt for the
cows, which sometimes went deep into the
wood to escape the tormenting flies.</p>

<p>As there was no other little girl to play with,
Buddie had to amuse herself as best she could.
One way was to turn the pages of a big, fine
book of animal stories, a Christmas gift from a
city friend of the family; and when all the pictures
had been looked at for the hundredth
time, she would call Colonel and ramble along
the edge of the wood, in the hope of seeing
some of the animals pictured in her book.</p>

<p>She never went more than a very little way
into the wood.</p>

<p>“For if you do,” her mother would say,
“the bears will eat you up.” So it was that
the wood came to have a great fascination for
her, as it would for you or me, Little One, if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
could not go into it. A great many of us always
wish to do what we are told not to do, which is
very wrong, of course, and discourages the wise
and patient people who write books on Ethics.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful wood, not at all like the
wood in your favorite fairy tale. You can hardly
realize, Little One, how far away it stretched—hundreds
and hundreds of miles—away to the
ice and snow of the far, far North. There were
no roads, as in your fairy-tale wood, and no
paths except a few old trails which had not been
used for years, and over which the wild grasses
and shrubs ran again. From the shore road
you could see into it only a little way, because
there were so many trees that had branches
close to the ground, and such a tangle of old
dead trees and thickly growing young ones.
During the day, when the sunlight crept in
through every crack, it was quite cheerful among
the pines and firs and birches, and a great deal
seemed to be going on there; but when night
came on it grew dark and still, and the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
speck of light for miles and miles came from
the lamp in the log house window.</p>

<p>Rather a lonely place, one would say, for a
little girl to grow up in. But Buddie never
thought of that. She was always busy, and the
days passed quickly enough. Colonel was a
lively companion, if he was only a dog, and a
yellow one at that; and he had one good
quality which even a yellow dog can have—he
was entirely devoted to his young mistress.
If she wandered too far
up or down the road, or
seemed to be disregarding
her mother’s command to
keep out of the wood, he
would take hold of her dress
with his teeth and gently
pull her back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>And now to return to the
strange flower Buddie found.
Pay attention, Little One: if it were not for the
flower I should not be telling you this story.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_007.jpg" alt="flower in Buddie's hair"></div>

<p>Botanists call it <i>Circæa Alpina</i>, but you
never could remember that. The other name
for it is “Enchanter’s Nightshade,” which you
may not forget so easily. It is a small plant,
and the flower books do not say much about it;
but I feel quite sure it must have originated on
the Ææan Isle, where Circe the Enchantress
lived, ever so many years ago. I think very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
likely Ulysses, whom you have read about or
will read about some day, carried off a bouquet
of it when he sailed away from the isle, and in
the course of time the seeds reached our land.
Anyhow, you must have guessed that there was
some sort of enchantment in Buddie’s bouquet,
even if I had not tried to explain; for no sooner
had she fastened it under her hair-ribbon than
Colonel exclaimed, in “really talk”:</p>

<p>“<i>Who cares for flowers! Throw me a stick
to fetch!</i>”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>ON THE WAY TO BEAVERTOWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>If a dog were to speak to you, Little One,
in “really talk,” I dare say you would jump a
foot—unless you happened to be sitting on a
fallen tree at the time; then, very likely, you
would do as Buddie did, jump to both feet.</p>

<p>“Why, Colonel!” she cried; “I didn’t know
you could talk.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” replied the Yellow Dog. “Well,
I assure you I am an excellent talker, if you
start me off on subjects in which I am interested.
Like all persons that really have something
to say, I need to be drawn out.”</p>

<p>Certainly he did not talk like a common dog,
and he no longer looked like one. He held his
head proudly, and his once dejected tail had an
upward and aristocratic sweep. Could this be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the same yellow dog that her father kicked
around and accused of stealing eggs? Buddie
rubbed her eyes and looked again. Yes; it
was the same dog: around his neck was the
rope collar with which she dragged him about.</p>

<p>Besides being an easy talker, Colonel seemed
to be something of a mind-reader.</p>

<p>“It is a common belief,” he went on, “that
all yellow dogs are good for is to kick around,
or to put the blame on when eggs are missing.
Now, I do not like eggs, and I do not know of
a single yellow dog that does. It only goes to
prove the old saying: Give a yellow dog a bad
name and it will stick to him like a bur to his
tail. But show me the yellow dog that is not
the equal, in good manners, courage and intelligence,
of any black or brown dog.”</p>

<p>Although Buddie lived a long way from any
village, she had seen a great many dogs. They
were mostly Indian curs, wolfish-looking creatures,
and the greatest thieves in the world.
Neglected by their owners, they foraged everywhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
often traveling miles in search of food,
and eating almost anything they could chew.
They were of all colors except yellow. Colonel
was the only yellow dog Buddie had ever seen.
And she was bound to admit that he was a much
more agreeable dog than the ravenous creatures
that came slinking around the log house every
now and then, in the hope of picking up even
so poor a meal as potato-parings or egg-shells.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> say, give the yellow dog a show,” declared
Colonel, sitting up on his haunches and
making a grand flourish with his right forepaw.
“Other dogs have shows, but you never hear
of a <i>yellow</i> dog show. Let justice be done,
though the sky falls.”</p>

<p>With his left forepaw he made another grand
flourish, and paused for a reply. But all Buddie
could think of was:</p>

<p>“I’m sure it wouldn’t be nice to have the
sky fall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is just a figure of speech, like, Let
justice be done,” said Colonel. “Nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
expects the sky to fall; though I dare say it
<i>would</i> if justice were done.”</p>

<p>Buddie did not quite understand what was
meant by a figure of speech, but, like many
older persons, she was impressed by large words
and an easy style of tossing them off; and it
seemed to her that Colonel was a very superior
person—if you could call a dog a person.</p>

<p>“If there are no more sticks to fetch,” said
Colonel, dropping again on all fours, “I think
I shall make a few calls on my friends in the
wood.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you get lost?” asked Buddie, peering
doubtfully into the dark grove of spruce
and balsam-fir.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replied Colonel, tossing his
head. “I very often go miles into the wood,
for I can always nose my way back again. How
would you like to pay a visit to my friend, the
Laziest Beaver? We’ll be sure to find him at
home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_013">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">AND LED THE WAY INTO A THICKET</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“The Laziest Beaver?” repeated Buddie, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
surprise. “Are beavers lazy?” She had often
heard her father say, when he had come home
tired at twilight, that he had “worked like a
beaver.”</p>

<p>“I have known a great many beavers in my
time,” Colonel replied, “and I never knew
one to do a stroke of work if he could get out
of it. Indeed, Lazy as a Beaver, is a common
expression in these parts. My friend, the Laziest
Beaver, never worked in his life.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go to see him,” cried Buddie,
happily. “Only, don’t go fast, as I can’t jump
over things the way you can.”</p>

<p>“Never fear,” replied Colonel. “I shall
show you the easiest paths. Besides, there is
no hurry; we have all day before us.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he cleared a huge log with a
graceful leap, and led the way into a thicket of
young poplar trees.</p>

<p>Now, I am quite sure, Little One, that in
going into the wood, Buddie did not mean to
disobey her mother; she never before had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
so. You are to believe, as I believe, that the
bouquet of Enchanter’s Nightshade in her hair
was to blame, just as it was the cause of everything
else that happened to her that wonderful
day.</p>

<p>At first Buddie had some trouble in following
her guide, who slipped through the brush with
an ease born of much practice. The little
branches caught in her hair, and tried to poke
out her eyes. But she soon learned to bend
her head at the right moment and shield her
eyes with her arms; and as they got deeper
into the wood, where the proud pine-trees grew
and the little bushes dared not intrude, walking
became almost as easy as along a road.</p>

<p>“This friend of mine, the Laziest Beaver,”
said Colonel, when Buddie stopped for a little
rest, “is always going to do something, but
never gets round to it. He’s been going to rebuild
a dam for I don’t know how long, and
he’s always talking about repairing his house,
which fell down about his ears last summer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
But he’d rather sit in the sun and tell stories
and exchange news. He’s the greatest gossip
in the woods—the crows are nothing to him—and
every one that wants to find out anything
goes straight to him.”</p>

<p>“Where does he live?” asked Buddie.</p>

<p>“Just a little way from here, at Beavertown.
It used to be quite a village, but last year the
beavers moved to a better place up the river.
The Laziest Beaver was too lazy to follow them;
so he lives all alone in his tumble-down house,
by the side of his tumble-down dam, and lies
out in the sun all day, and has just the laziest
time in the world. Shall we move along?”</p>

<p>Their way now led downhill to the river,
which, fortunately, it was not necessary to cross.
A little distance up-stream a smaller river came
in, and along the bank of this Colonel led the
way to a meadow of tall wild grass.</p>

<p>This was Beavertown.</p>

<small>THE LAZIEST BEAVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>They found the Laziest Beaver at home—just
as Colonel, the Yellow Dog, had promised—lying
in the sun in front of his tumble-down
dwelling, and fanning himself with lazy flaps of
his broad tail. He nodded pleasantly as Colonel
and Buddie approached, but made no
attempt to rise for a more formal greeting.</p>

<p>“This is Buddie,” said the Yellow Dog, presenting
her.</p>

<p>“Which Buddie?” asked the Laziest Beaver.</p>

<p>“Why, just Buddie.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of <i>some</i> Buddie, <i>any</i> Buddie,
<i>every</i> Buddie and <i>no</i> Buddie, but I never heard
of <i>just</i> Buddie before,” remarked the Laziest
Beaver.</p>

<p>“She lives in the log house by the lake,
where I stop,” Colonel explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“I’ve been meaning to get down to the lake
on a visit,” said the Laziest Beaver, “but I
can’t seem to find the time. There’s that dam
to build, you know, and my house needs a few
repairs.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="Talking with the Laziest Beaver"></div>

<p>Remembering what Colonel had told her
about the Laziest Beaver always talking of doing
something but never getting around to do
it, Buddie smiled, which was not at all polite.
The Laziest Beaver noticed the smile, and
changed the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“What’s the news?” he asked, addressing
the Yellow Dog.</p>

<p>“Carrying news to you would be carrying
sweets to a beehive,” replied Colonel, with a
bow. The Laziest Beaver was touched by the
flattery, and smiled amiably.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I do pick up a little news
now and then. By the way, Bunny Cotton-Tayle
was around here to-day. He is going
up to The Well this afternoon to find the answer,”
said the Laziest Beaver.</p>

<p>“What’s the answer?” asked Buddie, who
thought it no more than polite to take part in
the conversation.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” replied the Laziest Beaver.
“That’s what he’s going up to The Well to find
out.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand,” said Buddie,
much puzzled.</p>

<p>“She means,” said Colonel, “what is the
answer to what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the answer to <i>what</i> is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
unless it is <i>that</i>,” said the Laziest Beaver.
“You often hear people say, <i>that’s what</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> is not the question,” objected Colonel.</p>

<p>“Then she should have asked, What’s the
<i>question</i>? not, What’s the <i>answer</i>?” declared
the Laziest Beaver, triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Question! Question!” cried the Yellow
Dog.</p>

<p>“The question is,” said the Laziest Beaver,
“why does a rabbit wabble his nose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder why he does!” cried Buddie.
She had had a pet rabbit once upon a
time, and she used to feed him long spears of
grass, one after the other, and Bunny would
take them in just as a printing press takes in
rolls of paper—sitting perfectly still the while,
and wabbling and wabbling and wabbling his
nose.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he know why himself?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Of course not. If he did he wouldn’t have
to go up to The Well to find out, would he?”</p>

<p>“But how will he find out at The Well?
Who will tell him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Truth, of course. Doesn’t Truth lie at the
bottom of a well?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Buddie. “We haven’t
any well on our place; we get our water out of
the lake.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very remarkable thing,” said the Yellow
Dog, thoughtfully; “a very remarkable
thing. Nobody knows why a rabbit has to
wabble his nose.”</p>

<p>“There’s a song about it, isn’t there?”
asked the Laziest Beaver. “I believe I’ve
heard you sing it.”</p>

<p>“I believe I <i>have</i> sung it a few times,” answered
Colonel, modestly, although he was extremely
proud of his voice and never lost a
chance to show it off.</p>

<p>“Sing it for us,” said the Laziest Beaver. “I
haven’t heard any music for quite a while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please do!” urged Buddie.</p>

<p>“Really, I am so hoarse,” began Colonel,
apologetically.</p>

<p>“Oh, bark away!” said the Laziest Beaver.
“We can stand it if you can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Yes; <i>do</i> sing!” pleaded Buddie.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the Yellow Dog, who was
really anxious to sing, cleared his throat with a
preliminary,</p>

<p class="center x-ebookmaker-drop">[<a href="music/038.mp3">Listen</a>] [<a href="music/038.mxl">MusicXML</a>]</p>

<p>and began, in a light and rather throaty, but,
on the whole, pleasing voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Why a peach or a plum has of seeds only one,</div>

<div class="verse">We know why green peas—”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Pleasant weather we are having,” remarked
the Laziest Beaver to Buddie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered absently, her attention
on the song. She thought it kind of Colonel to
sing, and extremely impolite of the Laziest Beaver
to talk, especially as it was he that had asked
for the music. Meanwhile the Yellow Dog,
who had often sung in public, and so expected
talking, kept on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“We know why green peas make the best currant jell,</div>
<div class="indent">Why and wherefore the peanut-tree grows;</div>
<div class="verse">But, alack and alas! there is no one can tell</div>
<div class="indent">Why a rabbit should wabble his nose.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Our friend sings quite well, don’t you think
so?” went on the Laziest Beaver.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Buddie, pleasantly, though
inwardly vexed; and she nodded encouragement
to the Yellow Dog, who just then burst
into the chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“We’ve whispered it so you could hear it for miles;</div>
<div class="indent"><small>We’ve shouted it ‘under the rose’;</small></div>
<div class="verse">But alas and alack! only Echo calls back—</div>
<div class="indent">‘Oh—why—does—he—wabble—his—nose?’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The Laziest Beaver hummed the chorus very
much off the key and so loudly that Buddie
scarcely could make out the words of it.</p>

<p>“I do wish people wouldn’t talk when some
one is trying to sing,” she thought; and as
Colonel began the second verse she got up and
crossed over to where he was sitting, and paid
no further attention to the Laziest Beaver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent2">His—no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ose?’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>By this time the Laziest Beaver, who picked
up songs as quickly as gossip, had learned the
words and the tune of the chorus; and when
the Yellow Dog repeated it he joined in again—shouting
the first line, whispering the second,
and imitating Echo in the fourth. And so good
was the imitation that Buddie found herself
looking up and around for the voices in the air,
which grew fainter and fainter and fainter, and
at last died away in a long “no-o-o-o-o-o-o-se.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Then, much to her surprise, she discovered
that while she had been looking up and around,
the Yellow Dog and the Laziest Beaver had
vanished, and with them the tumble-down beaver
house and the meadow and the little river.
She was in the deep wood again, sitting on the
fallen trunk of a great pine-tree, and watching a
rabbit, who, apparently unconscious of her presence,
was regarding himself in a small hand-glass,
while he wabbled and wabbled and wabbled
his nose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>“WHY DOES A RABBIT WABBLE HIS NOSE?”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>How Buddie came to be whisked away from
Beavertown to a part of the wood that, so far
as she could tell, she had never seen before,
remains to this day a mystery.</p>

<p>“It was the echo,” she said, in telling me the
tale; “you just couldn’t help looking up.”
Certainly it must have been a remarkable echo;
and although it does not explain the matter entirely
to my satisfaction, it is as convincing as
any explanation I can offer. But, to go on
with the story:</p>

<p>The Rabbit continued to regard himself in
his mirror, wabbling his nose the while, until
Buddie wondered whether he intended to keep
it up all day. But at last he dropped the glass,
which was suspended on a cord about his neck,
and remarked, with a little sigh:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“It’s no use. I <i>can’t</i> make it out.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="Buddie talking with the Rabbit"></div>

<p>Buddie feared to move lest she send him
scampering off; rabbits were such timid creatures—that
is, all the rabbits she had ever come
upon before. Still, she wished to talk with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
about his funny nose; so she coughed softly to
attract his attention. This is an old trick and
usually succeeds. The Rabbit turned his head,
saw Buddie and exclaimed hurriedly, with a
friendly smile:</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, my dear!”</p>

<p>Buddie laughed outright.</p>

<p>“The idea of being afraid of a rabbit!” said
she.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded the Rabbit, in a tone
of offended dignity. “Size isn’t everything.”</p>

<p>“But rabbits are such scary little things,”
Buddie started to say, when the Rabbit interrupted
her.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of anybody,” he declared
with a little swagger. He emphasized the last
word so significantly, and it sounded so like
“any Buddie,” that Buddie hastened to say:</p>

<p>“I didn’t know rabbits were so brave. I
thought—”</p>

<p>“Never mind what you thought,” said the
Rabbit, curtly. “It doesn’t help matters a bit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Always speak twice before you think; then you
won’t make mistakes. Nearly all mistakes are
caused by hasty thinking. Didn’t you ever
hear the expression, Bold as a rabbit?”</p>

<p>Buddie shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard about, Bold as a lion,” she replied.</p>

<p>The Rabbit sniffed.</p>

<p>“Lions? What are they?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there are any around here,”
answered Buddie.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there <i>are</i>, either,” said the
Rabbit, with a self-satisfied smile. “But if
there were I should teach them their place fast
enough. The expression, Bold as a rabbit, is
common enough—as common as, Wise as a
goose, or, Silly as an owl, or, Fast as a snail,
or, Sleepy as a weasel—and it’s a wonder you
never heard it. Why, the word ‘hare-brained,’
or ‘rabbit-brained,’ means, bold to the point of
recklessness.”</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Buddie, “if this isn’t the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
queerest place anybody ever got into. Dogs
sing, beavers are lazy, and rabbits are bold as
lions. Everything seems to be upside down.
What next, I wonder? I suppose,” she said
aloud, “your name is Mr. Bunny Cotton-Tayle.”</p>

<p>The Rabbit bowed.</p>

<p>“And your name?” he asked politely.</p>

<p>“Buddie—just Buddie.” She was afraid he
might ask, “Which Buddie?” as the Laziest
Beaver had asked.</p>

<p>The Rabbit again consulted his mirror, and
inquired carelessly, as one inquires who does
not expect information:</p>

<p>“You don’t happen to know, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Why you wabble your nose?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“No,” confessed Buddie. “And I think it’s
funny <i>you</i> can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything funny in it,” said the
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“I mean strange.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Or strange. Why is a watermelon bald-headed,
while a carrot has whiskers? Answer
me that!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Buddie again confessed.</p>

<p>“Did you ever ask a watermelon?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. That’s perfectly ’diculous.
Who ever heard of a watermelon talking? But
still,” Buddie added to herself, “if a rabbit can
talk, why shouldn’t a watermelon?”</p>

<p>“Well, ask a watermelon sometime,” said
the Rabbit; “or ask a carrot. Neither of them
knows, any more than a dog knows when he’s
hot.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure a dog knows when he’s hot,” objected
Buddie.</p>

<p>“How do you know when <i>you’re</i> hot?” demanded
the Rabbit, with a this-is-where-I-trip-you-up
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Why, I get hot—I mean I get all sweaty
and have to wipe my face and neck.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said the Rabbit. “You know
when you’re hot because you sweat. But a dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
doesn’t sweat and can’t sweat. There! What
do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“If my dog Colonel were here,” said Buddie,
“I’m sure <i>he</i> could tell me.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t,” declared the Rabbit. “Told me
so himself, many a time. Haven’t you noticed
that on the hottest day a dog will race round and
run after sticks and stones and go on like mad
until he simply drops from exhaustion? Now,
if he could tell when he was hot, as you can, he
would stop long before he gave out. That sort
of thing is very wearing on a dog. That’s why
he doesn’t live longer.”</p>

<p>As Buddie had no suitable reply ready the
Rabbit continued:</p>

<p>“No, Buddie—I believe you said your name
was Buddie?” Buddie nodded. “It’s so like
my own—Bunny. No, Buddie, there are some
things about ourselves we can’t explain, just as
there are some things that are perfectly clear.
For instance, I know why I can not run very
far in a straight line, but have to zigzag.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Do tell me!” cried Buddie, greatly interested.</p>

<p>“The reason is, my hindlegs are twice as
long as my forelegs. After I run a little way
my hindlegs overtake my forelegs, and if I were
to keep on I should be going the other way,
which would be extremely awkward, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“I should think it <i>would</i> be,” murmured
Buddie, to whom the explanation was by no
means clear.</p>

<p>“Why, once when I started for home I was
in such a hurry I forgot to zigzag, and before
I realized it I was twice as far from home as
when I set out. So when I am chasing a fox
or a panther I have to make up in speed what
I lose in ground. But as for this nose-wabbling,”—the
Rabbit again consulted his pocket
mirror and sighed deeply—“<i>that</i> gets me. I
give it up. Even Doctor Goose, who knows
everything—or almost everything—can’t explain
<i>that</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“The Laziest Beaver said you were going
up to The Well to find the answer,” remarked
Buddie, who was very curious to find out what
sort of well it was.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am going up to The Well,” replied
the Rabbit. “But I am not the only one that
wishes to learn something. The Guinea-Pig
wants to know why his eyes fall out when you
hold him up by the tail.”</p>

<p>“But a guinea-pig hasn’t any tail,” said Buddie,
who had owned one, and was quite sure it
didn’t have a sign of a tail.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what sort of guinea-pigs you
are in the habit of associating with,” said the
Rabbit; “but all of my acquaintance have tails,
and good long ones. Why shouldn’t a guinea-pig
have a tail? A guinea-<i>hen</i> has.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why it shouldn’t, but I know
it <i>hasn’t</i>,” Buddie persisted.</p>

<p>“Well, here comes the Guinea-Pig now,”
said the Rabbit; “and if that isn’t a tail he’s
wearing, I don’t know a tail when I see it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Buddie looked around and saw, almost at her
feet, the dearest Guinea-Pig imaginable. She
gave a cry of delight and stretched out her
hand to caress it, just as she used to caress her
own pet before it fell victim to a foraging fox.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="Buddie lifting up the Guinea-Pig"></div>

<p>Now, Buddie did not mean to do it, but it
came about in this way: startled by her exclamation,
the Guinea-Pig turned and made off;
Buddie reached forward eagerly, caught him,
and lifted him up—by the tail!</p>

<p>Instantly his eyes fell out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“There! You’ve done it!” cried the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“I wish people wouldn’t pick me up by the
tail,” sobbed the Guinea-Pig. He couldn’t
weep, you see, because his eyes were out.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor thing!” cried Buddie. And
getting down on her hands and knees, she began
hunting for the little creature’s eyes, which had
rolled under the leaves.</p>

<small>THE GUINEA-PIG WHOSE EYES FELL OUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Really, I didn’t mean to pick you up by
the tail,” said Buddie, turning over the leaves
in search of the missing eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s what they all say,” sobbed the
Guinea-Pig. “Can’t you find them? It never
took so long before.”</p>

<p>“Here’s one! What a teeny little eye! And
here’s the other! How do you put them back?”
Buddie asked the Rabbit, who, mirror in hand,
was again studying his nose.</p>

<p>“Ask the Guinea-Pig; they’re <i>his</i> eyes,”
replied the Rabbit. “I have troubles of my
own.”</p>

<p>Buddie took the Guinea-Pig in her lap.</p>

<p>“If I’m not doing it right you must tell me,”
she said. “And <i>do</i> stop sobbing; it shakes
your head so I can’t do a thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“I can’t stop,” blubbered the Guinea-Pig.
“If I don’t cry I have to sob.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>cry</i> a little, then, for a change. You
won’t shake so.”</p>

<p>“But I <i>can’t</i> cry,” wailed the unhappy
Guinea-Pig. “My eyes are out. Oh! oh!”</p>

<p>He gave a little squeak, more of fright than
of pain, for Buddie had grasped him so tightly
that he couldn’t shake, and scarcely could
breathe.</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed triumphantly, slipping
back the eyes. “Now you’re all right,
and I’ll never pick you up by the tail again, you
dear, dear little thing!”</p>

<p>She stroked him affectionately, but the
Guinea-Pig, instead of cheering up, wept like a
baby. His brown eyes fairly streamed tears.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” he cried. “Everything’s upside
down!”</p>

<p>“I know it, dearie,” said Buddie, soothingly.
She was getting used to the topsy-turviness of
the wood, and she was not the least surprised
to hear the Guinea-Pig wail forth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“You’re standing on your head! You’re
standing on your head!”</p>

<p>“It only <i>seems</i> so to you,” Buddie replied.
“You shouldn’t live in such a ’diculous wood,
you know.”</p>

<p>“You’ve put his eyes in upside down, stupid!”
said the Rabbit. “You ought to be more
careful.”</p>

<p>“Dear! dear!” exclaimed Buddie, in dismay.
“What’s to be done now?”</p>

<p>“Pick him up by the tail again,” was the
brief advice.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” bawled the Guinea-Pig. “Must
I go through all that again?”</p>

<p>“Don’t take on so,” soothed Buddie. “It’s
for your own good. And we shan’t lose the
eyes this time. We really shan’t.”</p>

<p>As gently as possible she lifted the Guinea-Pig
by the tail, and when his eyes fell out she
caught them in her hand.</p>

<p>“Be sure to put the right eye on the right
side and the left eye on the left side,” said the
Rabbit, “Otherwise he’ll be cross-eyed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“I wonder which is which,” said the puzzled
Buddie. “They ought to be marked.”</p>

<p>“You know the old rule for telling the left
one. It’s the one you pick up second.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” said Buddie, who had
never heard the old rule.</p>

<p>“If you pick up one, the other is <i>left</i>, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“But does it matter which one you pick up
first?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. How stupid you are!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try this one,” said Buddie.</p>

<p>“That’s <i>right</i>,” said the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“There! I do hope I haven’t made any
mistake,” said Buddie, when the operation was
over. “Goodness! What are you crying about
now? Do your eyes pain you?” For the
Guinea-Pig continued to weep as if his little
heart were broken.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mind him,” said the Rabbit.
“He’s that way nearly all the time. Tell her
the story of your life, old fellow,” he suggested,
patting his weeping friend on the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Yes, do!” encouraged Buddie. “It must
be very sad,” she remarked to the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Yes—when you’ve heard it for the first
time,” he replied. “Come,”—to the Guinea-Pig,—“cheer
up!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps if it’s so sad he may not want to
tell us,” suggested Buddie, who was beginning
to feel a bit tearful herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, he likes to talk about it,” said the Rabbit.
“Everybody likes to talk about his own
affairs. There’s my nose, for instance. Go on,
old fellow. ‘I was born—’”</p>

<p>The Guinea-Pig dried his eyes with the back
of his paw, sniffed once or twice and began:</p>

<p>“I was born in a large wire cage, in a doctor’s
office, at the age of one.”</p>

<p>“How <i>could</i> you be?” Buddie interrupted.
“You couldn’t be one year old when you were
born, you know.”</p>

<p>“He means one <i>second</i>,” explained the Rabbit.
“Don’t interrupt, or he’ll start bawling
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Next door to us lived another family of
guinea-pigs,” went on Brown Eyes. “There
were two daughters—one of them the sweetest,
dearest—”</p>

<p>Here the Guinea-Pig broke down, and it was
some time before he was able to resume his story.</p>

<p>“One day some visitors came to the office,
and the doctor took me out and exhibited me to
them. ‘Is he old enough to kill?’ asked one
of the visitors. ‘Just the right age and weight,
two hundred and fifty grams,’ replied the doctor.
And before I could realize the meaning of
these dreadful words he seized a glittering instrument
and plunged it into my body.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Buddie, horrified. A
warning glance from the Rabbit checked further
comment.</p>

<p>“For twenty-four hours I lay senseless; and
when I came to—alas! what was there to come
to?—I was alone in the world! All, all were
gone, the old familiar faces; and the doctor
was looking into my cage and saying: ‘Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
well! You’re a tough little Guinea-Pig, and no
mistake.’”</p>

<p>A fresh flood of tears delayed the recital, and
the Rabbit, who was anxious to be off, looked
his impatience. With an effort the Guinea-Pig
continued:</p>

<p>“I had tuberculosis in March, diphtheria in
April, tetanus in May, and anthrax in June;
but—but I recovered—”</p>

<p>“Of course you did,” said the Rabbit, cheerily;
“otherwise you wouldn’t be here. Well,
I’ve got to be moving along, as I have several
important matters to attend to.”</p>

<p>“There! Don’t cry any more, Brown Eyes,”
said Buddie, wiping the Guinea-Pig’s eyes with
a corner of her dress.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the Rabbit, “how
would you like to look in on the Greenwood
Club this afternoon? You can come as my
guest, you know.”</p>

<p>“Ever so much!” replied Buddie, happily.</p>

<p>“Doctor Goose is to read a paper; and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
will be games and singing and the usual good
time. We get together once a week, and even
the Guinea-Pig forgets his troubles. Don’t
you, old fellow?”</p>

<p>But Brown Eyes only snuffled.</p>

<p>“If you will meet me at the Corner at two
o’clock,” said the Rabbit to Buddie, “I shall
be happy to escort you to the Club. Good
morning!” He bowed and hurried away.</p>

<p>“What corner?” Buddie called after him.
“<i>What corner?</i> <span class="smcap">What Corner?</span>”</p>

<p>But only an echo came back; and not, oddly
enough, an echo of her own words, but something
that sounded like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“His no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ose—</div>
<div class="verse">Wabble his nose—</div>
<div class="verse">Why does he wabble his nose?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And, like everything else in this queer wood,
the echo was upside down. That is to say, it
began faintly and grew clearer, clearer, clearer,
until the wood rang with it.</p>

<p>It seemed to come from somewhere overhead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
and Buddie looked up. As she did so, the interlacing
tree-tops melted away, and the patches
of sky ran together and became one big sheet
of blue. Gradually she lowered her eyes, and—</p>

<p>There she was back in Beavertown, in the
meadow bordering the little river. And there
was the Laziest Beaver, lying in the sun and
fanning himself with his tail. And there was
the Yellow Dog, just finishing the chorus of his
song, <i>Nobody Knows</i>.</p>

<p>Now wouldn’t that surprise you, Little One?</p>

<p>“Do you know, I think the twenty-third
verse is the best of the lot,” said the Laziest
Beaver. “Don’t you?”—appealing to Buddie.</p>

<p>“Why—I like them all,” she answered,
much bewildered; and she pinched herself to
make certain she was wide awake. “For,”
she said to herself, “I must have fallen asleep
and dreamed about the Rabbit and the Guinea-Pig.
Have you sung twenty-three verses?”
she asked the Yellow Dog.</p>

<p>“I’m just beginning the thirty-seventh,” he
replied. “If you’re tired of the song I’ll stop.”</p>

<p>“Oh no; <i>do</i> go on!” cried Buddie. “But,
you see, I lost count. Not that it matters a
bit,” she added to herself; “one verse sounds
just like another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>The song <i>was</i> rather monotonous. You can
get a very good idea of how the fiftieth verse
sounded by singing the first verse twenty-five or
thirty times.</p>

<p>“Bark away!” said the Laziest Beaver.
“You’re wasting time.”</p>

<p>The Yellow Dog cleared his throat, which
Buddie thought must be getting tired, and resumed:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Again that peculiar echo, the words of which
seemed to play hide-and-seek right over Buddie’s
head:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Wabble—his—nose—</div>
<div class="verse">His—no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ose”—</div>
</div></div>

<p>She looked up—to see the open sky break
into little patches, as the tree-tops ran together;
and when she looked
down—lo! the Yellow
Dog and the Laziest
Beaver, the meadow
and the little river had
again vanished, and she
was back in the deep
wood where she had
met the Rabbit and the
Guinea-Pig.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="Buddie calling Colonel"></div>

<p>“So I didn’t dream it,
after all,” she thought.
“I’m glad of that; for
perhaps I shall see them
again. Only, I do wish
these creatures wouldn’t
go away so suddenly. It makes you feel funny
all over. I wonder if Colonel is very far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
here. Perhaps he can hear me if I call.” And
she began shouting at the top of her voice (and
it was a long way to the top of it, I assure you):</p>

<p>“Colonel! <i>Colonel!</i> COLONEL!”</p>

<p>“Never halloo till you’re out of the wood,”
piped a small voice.</p>

<p>Buddie looked about her and saw, perched
on a balsam limb, a snow-white bird, who,
with his head cocked on one side, was regarding
her with the most comical expression imaginable.</p>

<p>“Never halloo till you are out of the wood,”
he piped again.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Buddie.</p>

<p>“Because you’ll start the bark of the dogwood
trees, and they’ll make noise enough to
wake the dead leaves.”</p>

<p>This seemed a sufficient reason, and Buddie
changed the subject.</p>

<p>“I never saw such a very white bird,” she
said, gazing admiringly at her new acquaintance.
The lake gulls were not nearly so snowy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“I’m not a whitebird; I’m a blackbird,” replied
Snowfeathers.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of contradicting?” Buddie
reflected. “Everything in this queer wood is
wrong-end-to. Won’t you come down?” she
invited, stretching out one hand. But the bird
cocked his little head on t’other side and answered:</p>

<p>“A bird in the bush is worth two in the hand.”</p>

<p>“But I won’t hurt you, dearie,” coaxed Buddie,
in such a sweet voice that Snowfeathers
flew down from the balsam and perched on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard my papa say, You might as well
try to catch a white blackbird,” said Buddie,
stroking him; “but I’ve caught <i>you</i>, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“And what did your papa mean by that,
pray?” asked Snowfeathers.</p>

<p>“Why—I suppose—that there wasn’t any
such thing. It’s perfectly ’diculous for a blackbird
to be white.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see any green or red blackberries?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“BUT I’VE CAUGHT YOU”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Buddie was somewhat taken aback by this
question. “But they weren’t ripe, you know,”
she said, after thinking a bit.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps <i>I’m</i> not ripe,” said the White
Blackbird; and that put an end to the argument.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Buddie, suddenly remembering
her engagement with the Rabbit, “can you tell
me where the Corner is?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the White Blackbird.
“As the crow flies, it’s five trees straight ahead,
ten to the right, fifteen straight ahead, twenty
to the right, twenty-five straight ahead, thirty
to the right, and then straight ahead to the
Corner. You can’t miss it.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! I never could remember that!”
said Buddie.</p>

<p>“It’s as easy as rolling off a prairie,” said
Snowfeathers. “Just keep to the right, and
count five—ten—fifteen—twenty—twenty-five—thirty.
All you really have to keep in mind
is the dead trees; they don’t count.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“My papa says crows fly in a straight line,
like bees,” ventured Buddie.</p>

<p>“It would take you a week to go by a B
line,” replied Snowfeathers. “Evidently you
don’t know what a B line is. Here’s one.”</p>

<p>Snowfeathers flew into
the air, and described
a number of graceful
curves.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_056.jpg" alt="Bee buzzing"></div>

<p>“Catch the idea?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said Buddie.</p>

<p>“You are not very observant,” said the bird.
“Don’t you know a B line when you see it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see any bee,” replied the puzzled
Buddie.</p>

<p>“Then you <i>don’t</i> know a B when you see
it,” said Snowfeathers.</p>

<p>“But my papa says a bee-line is straight,”
persisted Buddie, not so sure that her father
wasn’t right and Snowfeathers wrong.</p>

<p>“Your papa seems to know a great many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
things that aren’t so,”
was the White Blackbird’s
reply. “I dare say he tells you that the
early bird catches the worm.”</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_057a.jpg" alt="White Blackbird"></div>

<p>Buddie nodded.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_057b.jpg" alt="Buddie watching the White Blackbird"></div>

<p>“Which goes to prove that if you repeat a
thing enough times you come to believe it.
Now, the early bird
does nothing of the
sort. Mind, I don’t say
he <i>couldn’t</i> catch the
worm; worms are such
stupid creatures that
any bird can catch them,
at any time of day. But
they are much too hearty
for breakfast. One
shouldn’t eat meat
more than once a day;
and as for feeding it to
fledglings, that is not
to be thought of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Then, what <i>do</i> you eat for breakfast?”
asked Buddie.</p>

<p>“Usually cracked wheat or rolled oats or some
other kind of bird-seed—when I can get it. Then,
I’m very fond of cherries and other small fruits.
That’s why most birds make their homes in a
farming country, where there is plenty of the
right sort of breakfast food. I live some way
south of here, in a wheat country, where I can
have cracked wheat every morning; but once a
year I take a trip into the pine woods for the
benefit of my lungs. It’s no place for a small
bird to <i>live</i>, though it does very well for a
health trip. But you said you were going up
to the Corner. If you wish, I’ll show you the
way.”</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much,” said Buddie.
“I’ll count the trees, and you must tell me
when I make mistakes. And now,”—jumping
up—“which way do we go first?”</p>

<p>“Straight ahead,” said Snowfeathers, again
perching on her shoulder. And the two set out
for the Corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>The first turn was
reached without mistake,
as there were only
five trees to count, and
there was no doubt
that all of them
were alive.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Now, ten to the right,” said the White
Blackbird.</p>

<p>But Buddie got no farther. The sound of
music came to her ears, and she stopped to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
listen. The music was faint and sweet, with
the sighful quality of an Æolian harp. Now it
seemed near, now far.</p>

<p>“What can it be?” said Buddie.</p>

<p>“Wait here and I’ll find out,” said Snowfeathers.
He darted away and returned before
you could count fifty.</p>

<p>“A traveling musician,” he reported. “Come
along. It’s only a little way.”</p>

<p>Back he flew, with Buddie scrambling after.
A few yards brought her to a little open place,
and here was the queerest sight she had yet
seen in this queer wood.</p>

<p>On a bank of reindeer moss, at the foot of a
great white birch, a mouse-colored donkey sat
playing a lute. Over his head, hanging from a
bit of bark, was the sign:</p>

<small>A TRAVELED DONKEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>After the many strange things that Buddie
had come upon in Queerwood, nothing could
surprise her very much. Besides, as she never
before had seen a donkey, or a lute, or the combination
of donkey and lute, it did not strike
her as especially remarkable that the musician
should be holding his instrument upside down,
and sweeping the strings with one of his long
ears, which he was able to wave without moving
his head a jot. And this it was that gave
to the music its soft and furry-purry quality.</p>

<p>The Donkey greeted Buddie with a careless
nod, and remarked, as if anticipating a comment
he had heard many times:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I play everything <i>by ear</i>.”</p>

<p>“Please keep on playing,” said Buddie, taking
a seat on another clump of reindeer moss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“I intended to,” said the Donkey; and the
random chords changed to a crooning melody
which wonderfully pleased Buddie, whose opportunities
to hear music were sadly few. As
for the White Blackbird, he tucked his little
head under his wing and went fast asleep.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of it?” asked the
Donkey, putting down the lute.</p>

<p>“Very nice, sir,” answered Buddie, enthusiastically;
though she added to herself: “The
idea of saying ‘sir’ to an animal! Would you
please tell me your name?” she requested.</p>

<p>The Donkey pawed open a saddle-bag, drew
forth with his teeth a card, and presented it to
Buddie, who spelled out the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="center"><span class="large">PROFESSOR BRAY</span><br>
TENORE BARITONALE<br>

CONCERTS AND RECITALS</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>While Buddie was reading this the Donkey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
again picked up his instrument and thrummed
the strings.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see a donkey play a lute?”
said he. “That’s an old saw,” he added.</p>

<p>“I never saw a donkey before,” said Buddie.</p>

<p>“You haven’t traveled much,” said the other.
“The world is full of them.”</p>

<p>“This is the farthest I’ve ever been from
home,” confessed Buddie, feeling very insignificant
indeed.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_064a.jpg" alt="Donkey"></div>

<p>“And how far may that be?”</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_064b.jpg" alt="Buddie"></div>

<p>Buddie couldn’t tell exactly.</p>

<p>“But it can’t be a great way,” she said. “I
live in the log house by the lake.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Donkey. “That’s no distance
at all.” Buddie shrank another inch or
two. “I’m a great traveler myself. All donkeys
travel that can. If a donkey travels, you
know, he <i>may</i> come home a horse; and to become
a horse is, of course, the ambition of
every donkey!”</p>

<p>“Is it?” was all Buddie could think of to remark.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
What could she say that would interest
a globe-trotter?</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have an old saw you’d like
reset,” suggested the Donkey, still thrumming
the lute-strings.</p>

<p>Buddie thought a moment.</p>

<p>“There’s an old saw hanging up in our woodshed,”
she began, but got no
further.</p>

<p>“Hee-haw! hee-haw!”
laughed the Donkey. “Thistles
and cactus, but that’s rich!”
And he hee-hawed until
the tears ran down his
nose. Poor Buddie, who
knew she was
being laughed
at but didn’t
know why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
began to feel very much like crying and wished
she might run away.</p>

<p>“Excuse these tears,” the Donkey said at last,
recovering his family gravity. “Didn’t you ever
hear the saying, A burnt child dreads the fire?”</p>

<p>Buddie nodded, and plucked up her spirits.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s an old saw. And you must
have heard that other very old saw, No use crying
over spilled milk.”</p>

<p>Another nod from Buddie.</p>

<p>“Here’s my setting of that,” said the Donkey;
and after a few introductory chords, he
sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>If you would like to know what sort of composer
the Donkey was, you may play the song
printed on the page opposite to this.</p>

<p>“How do you like my voice?” asked the
Donkey, in a tone that said very plainly: “If
you don’t like it you’re no judge of singing.”</p>

<p>Buddie did not at once reply. A professional
critic would have said, and enjoyed
saying, that the voice was of the hit-or-miss variety;
that it was pitched too high (all donkeys
make that mistake); that it was harsh, rasping
and unsympathetic, and that altogether the performance
was “not convincing.”</p>

<p>Now, Little One, although Buddie was not
a professional critic, and neither knew how to
wound nor enjoyed wounding, even <i>she</i> found
the Donkey’s voice harsh; but she did not wish
to hurt his feelings—for donkeys <i>have</i> feelings,
in spite of a popular opinion to the contrary.
And, after all, it was pretty good singing for a
donkey. Critics should not, as they sometimes
do, apply to donkeys the standards by which
nightingales are judged. So Buddie was able
to say, truthfully and kindly:</p>

<p>“I think you do very well; very well, indeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>It was a small tribute, but the Donkey was
so blinded by conceit that he accepted it as the
greatest compliment.</p>

<p>“I <i>ought</i> to sing well,” he said. “I’ve
studied methods enough. The more methods
you try, you know, the more of a donkey you
are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” murmured Buddie, not understanding
in the least.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on the Donkey; “I’ve taken
the Donkesi Method, the Sobraylia Method, the
Thistlefixu Method—”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t quite know what you
mean by ‘methods,’” ventured Buddie.</p>

<p>The Donkey regarded her with a pitying
smile.</p>

<p>“A method,” he explained, “is a way of
singing ‘Ah!’ For example, in the Thistlefixu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Method, which I am at present using, I
fill my mouth full of thistles, stand on one leg,
take in a breath three yards long, and sing
‘Ah!’ The only trouble with this method is
that the thistles tickle your throat and make
you cough, and you have to spray the vocal
cords twice a day, which is considerable trouble,
especially when traveling, as <i>I</i> always am.”</p>

<p>“I should think it <i>would</i> be,” said Buddie.
“Won’t you sing something else?”</p>

<p>“I’m a little hoarse,” apologized the singer.</p>

<p>“That’s what you want to be, isn’t it?” said
Buddie, misunderstanding him.</p>

<p>“Hee-haw!” laughed the Donkey. “Is that
a joke? I mean my <i>throat</i> is hoarse.”</p>

<p>“And the rest of you is donkey!” cried Buddie,
who could see a point as quickly as any
one of her age.</p>

<p>“There’s something to that,” said the other,
thoughtfully. “Now, if the <i>hoarseness</i> should
spread—”</p>

<p>“And you became <i>horse</i> all over—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Why, then—”</p>

<p>“Why, then—”</p>

<p>“Think of another old saw,” said the Donkey,
picking up his lute.</p>

<small>OLD SAWS IN NEW SETTINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“No; I don’t believe I can remember any
more old saws,” said Buddie, after racking her
small brain for a minute or two.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Donkey. “They’re as
common as, Pass the butter, or, Some more
tea, please. Ever hear, Fair words butter no
parsnips?”</p>

<p>Buddie shook her head.</p>

<p>“The wolf does something every day that
keeps him from church on Sunday—?”</p>

<p>Again Buddie shook her head.</p>

<p>“It is hard to shave an egg—?”</p>

<p>Still another shake.</p>

<p>“A miss is as good as a mile? You can not
drive a windmill with a pair of bellows? Help
the lame dog over the stile? A hand-saw is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
good thing, but not to shave with? Nothing
venture, nothing have? Well, you haven’t
heard much, for a fact,” said the Donkey, contemptuously,
as Buddie shook her head after
each proverb. “I’ll try a few more; there’s
no end to them. Ever hear, When the sky falls
we shall all catch larks? Too many cooks spoil
the broth?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard <i>that</i>,” said Buddie, eagerly.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder,” returned the Donkey.
“Well, I have a very nice setting of that.”
And he sang:</p>

<p>“I like that,” said Buddie. “Oh, and I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
just thought of another old ax—I mean saw, if
it <i>is</i> one—Don’t count your chickens before
they are hatched. Do you sing that?”</p>

<p>“One of my best,” replied the Donkey. And
again he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“‘Thirteen eggs,’ said Sammy Patch,</div>
<div class="verse">‘Are thirteen chickens when they hatch.’</div>
<div class="verse">The hen gave a cluck, but said no more;</div>
<div class="verse">For the hen had heard such things before.</div>
</div>

<div class="first">“The eggs fall out from tilted pail</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Oh, Sammy Patch, your ’rithmetic</div>
<div class="verse">Won’t hatch a solitary chick.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“I like that the best,” said Buddie, who
knew what it was to tip over a pail of eggs,
and felt as sorry for Sammy Patch as if he
really existed.</p>

<p>“It’s one of my best,” said the Donkey. “I
don’t call it my very best. Personally I prefer,
Look before you leap. You’ve heard that old
saw, I dare say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“No; but that doesn’t matter. I shall like
it just as well,” replied Buddie.</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> doesn’t follow, but <i>this</i> does,” said
the Donkey, and once more he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“A foolish Frog, one summer day,</div>
<div class="verse">While splashing round in careless way,</div>

<div class="verse">‘A safer place than on this log;</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Buddie, however, clung to her former opinion.
“I like <i>Sammy Patch</i> the best,” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“That,” rejoined the singer, “is a matter of
taste, as the donkey said to the horse who preferred
hay to thistles. Usually the public likes
best the very piece the composer himself cares
least about. So wherever I go I hear, ‘Oh,
Professor, do sing us that beautiful song about
Sammy Patch.’ And I can’t poke my head
inside the Thistle Club but some donkey bawls
out, ‘Here’s Bray! Now we’ll have a song.
Sing us <i>Sammy Patch</i>, old fellow.’ Really,
I’ve sung that song so many times I’m tired of
the sound of it.”</p>

<p>“It must be nice to be such a favorite,” said
Buddie.</p>

<p>“Suppose we go up to the Corner and see
what’s stirring,” suggested the Donkey, with a
yawn.</p>

<p>“Oh, are <i>you</i> going up to the Corner, too?”
cried Buddie. “I am to meet the Rabbit there
at two o’clock. I hope it isn’t late.”</p>

<p>The Donkey glanced skyward.</p>

<p>“It isn’t noon yet,” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_077">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE WOOD</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“How do you tell time?” inquired Buddie.</p>

<p>“By the way it flies. Time flies, you know.
You can tell a great many birds that way, too.”
As he spoke the Donkey put his lute into one
of his bags and took down his sign.</p>

<p>“You can ride if you wish,” he offered graciously.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Buddie. And leaving
the White Blackbird asleep on his perch,—for,
as Buddie said, he was having such a lovely
nap it would be a pity to wake him,—they set
off through the wood.</p>

<p>It was bad traveling for a short distance, but
presently they came out on an old log-road;
and along this the Donkey ambled at an easy
pace. On both sides grew wild flowers in wonderful
abundance, but, as Buddie noticed, they
were all of one kind—Enchanter’s Nightshade.</p>

<p>Buddie had also noticed, when she climbed
to her comfortable seat, a peculiar marking on
the Donkey’s broad back. It was bronze in
color, and in shape like a cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Perhaps it’s a strawberry mark,” she
thought, “and he may not want to talk about
it.” But curiosity got the better of her.</p>

<p>“Oh, that?” said the Donkey, carelessly, in
reply to a question. “That’s a Victoria Cross.
I served three months with the British army in
South Africa, and was decorated for gallantry
in leading a charge of the ambulance corps. I
shall have to ask you not to hang things on
my neck. It’s all I can do to hold up my
head.”</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me,” said Buddie, untying the
sign, <span class="smcap">Old Saws Reset While You Wait</span>.</p>

<p>“Hang it round your own neck,” said the
Donkey, and Buddie did so.</p>

<p>“I often wonder,” she said, “whether a
horse doesn’t sometimes get tired holding his
head out at the end of his neck. And as for a
giraffe, I don’t see how he stands it.”</p>

<p>“Well, a giraffe’s neck runs out at a more
convenient angle,” said the Donkey. “Still,
it <i>is</i> tiresome without a check-rein. You hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
a great deal about a check-rein being a cruel
invention, but, on the contrary, it’s a great
blessing. Now, a nose-bag is a positive outrage,
and the more oats it contains the more of
an imposition it is. People have the queerest
ideas!”</p>

<p>At this moment Buddie’s sharp eyes discovered
a large animal ahead of them, at a bend of
the road.</p>

<p>“Goodness! It’s a bear!” she exclaimed
when they drew nearer.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” said the Donkey.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of bears,” confided Buddie.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Donkey. “They’re the
mildest creatures in the world.”</p>

<p>In spite of this assurance Buddie was glad
she was not alone, else she certainly would have
taken to her heels.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>TROUBLES OF A BEAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Bear was sitting on a wayside stump and
looking up the road. That is, he would have
been looking up the road if his eyes had been
open instead of shut.</p>

<p>“He’s asleep,” whispered Buddie. “Don’t
wake him.” For she could not quite bring
herself to believe the Donkey’s statement that
bears are the mildest creatures in the world,
even if you don’t eat their porridge, and break
their chairs, and rumple their beds, as the
naughty old woman in the revised edition of
the old story did.</p>

<p>The Bear raised his head slowly and turned
on the new-comers a pair of tired-looking eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t sleep,” said he.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Donkey. “You’re half-asleep
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“That’s just it,” returned the Bear, with a
sigh. “I can’t get more than <i>half</i>-asleep.”</p>

<p>He really did appear gentle, and Buddie ventured
to address him.</p>

<p>“If you sleep all winter—,” she began.</p>

<p>“Who said I slept all winter?” demanded
the Bear, indignantly.</p>

<p>“I thought all bears did,” replied Buddie,
confused.</p>

<p>“And ever since the first of May, when I
moved,” went on the Bear, “I haven’t slept
<i>at all</i>.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t earn much in the Land of
Nod, where they pay you for sleeping,” said
the Donkey. “That’s another old saw,” he
added in an aside to Buddie.</p>

<p>“Do you sing that, too?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; but you’ll have to get down,” the
Donkey replied. “It’s very hard to sing with
some one on your back,—though I <i>have</i> studied
that method.”</p>

<p>Buddie slid down and handed the lute to the
Donkey, who immediately began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>“Very true,” said the Bear, disconsolately,
when the song was done. “But what’s the use
of going to bed if you can’t sleep? You don’t
know what it is”—appealing to Buddie—“to
lie awake all night and listen to the servants
snoring and <i>you</i> unable to get a wink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Buddie certainly had no personal knowledge
of such an unpleasant state of affairs. She slept
“like a top” from dark to daybreak, and did
not even hear Colonel, weary from the day’s
play, snoring under the kitchen stove. Still,
she thought she ought to make some reply to
the Bear’s appeal for sympathy; so she said:</p>

<p>“Do you keep servants?”</p>

<p>“Six,” answered the Bear; “and a worthless
lot they are.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got something on your mind; that’s
why you can’t sleep,” said the Donkey, with
an air that implied, “You needn’t try to deceive
<i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” said the Bear.</p>

<p>“Then the best thing for you to do is to confess,”
said the Donkey, decisively. “A clear
conscience is the best sleeping powder. Come,
out with it! You’ve been stealing sheep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t anything of that sort,” said the
Bear, hastily. “I’ve been this way ever since
I moved, last May.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Sometimes when I’ve eaten a late supper I
don’t go to sleep right away,” said the Donkey.
“In such cases I begin counting two
hundred sheep going through the bars, one by
one, and by the time I get to a hundred and
twenty-three—why, I’m snoring.”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried that,” said the Bear. “It doesn’t
work.”</p>

<p>“Well, try counting the nuts on a tree, or
the blueberries on a bush.”</p>

<p>“I have—over and over.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t count slowly enough.
That makes a difference.”</p>

<p>“Not with me,” said the Bear, half-closing
his eyes. “I’ve imagined a crow flying round—and
round—and round,”—his voice grew
drowsy;—“I’ve imagined a squirrel going
round—and round—and round a tree,”—his
voice grew drowsier and drowsier;—“I’ve
counted both ways from a hundred; I’ve
counted up to twenty-three hundred—multiplied
by eighty-four—subtracted nine hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
and ninety-nine—divided by seven—added six
hundred and thirty—put down eight and car-r-i-e-d
three-e-e-e—”</p>

<p>The Bear’s voice died away in a whisper,
and his head drooped.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What was the answer?</span>” the Donkey
shouted in his ear.</p>

<p>“You needn’t holler so,” said the Bear, with
a start. “I wasn’t asleep.”</p>

<p>“You were <i>half</i>-asleep,” said the Donkey.</p>

<p>“Ever since I moved,” repeated the Bear.</p>

<p>Now, Buddie did not pretend to be as wise
as the Donkey, but she had wit enough to perceive
that there was some connection between
the Bear’s May moving and his lying awake
o’nights. So she inquired:</p>

<p>“Don’t you like the new place you moved
to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; quite well, indeed,” was the reply.
“The neighborhood is the very best; the
rooms are large and well lighted, with fine
hardrock floors; the roof doesn’t leak, and altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
it’s the best place I ever lived in. But
the trouble is, I can’t decide how to furnish my
den. Here it is August, and I haven’t done a
thing to it. It’s on my mind night and day.
One person advises this, another that, another
something else. Would you say black curtains
or pink?” the Bear asked Buddie.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_087.jpg" alt="Buddie and the Bear"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Oh, pink,” she replied, as that was her
favorite color.</p>

<p>“That’s what Doctor Goose advises; but
Doctor Fox thinks black would be better, as it
would harmonize with my fur.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the Donkey, “that
such matters might be left to Mrs. Bear.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any,” returned the Bear, with a
sigh. “I’m a bachelor.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Buddie.</p>

<p>“A bachelor,” replied the Donkey, “is a
person who lives in a den and doesn’t have to
worry about anybody except himself.”</p>

<p>“Are you a bachelor, too?” Buddie asked.</p>

<p>“No,” sighed the Donkey.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” Buddie thought. “One is
sorry because he is, and the other because he
isn’t. Then there isn’t any Middle Bear and
Little Small Wee Bear?” she said aloud, a little
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Evidently not,” said the Donkey.</p>

<p>“Only the Great Hooge Bear?”</p>

said the Bear.</p>

<p>At this strange word Buddie wrinkled her
small brows.</p>

<p>“You mean insomnia,” corrected the Donkey.</p>

<p>“I mean I can’t sleep; that’s what I mean,”
said the Bear. “Will you take dinner with
me?” he asked, looking from Buddie to the
Donkey. “It would be a great honor.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you put it that way, of course we
will,” said the Donkey, speaking for both of
them. “Will there be thistles?”</p>

<p>“I can send out for them.”</p>

<p>“Scotch thistles, please; they’re the best.
And I hope it isn’t far.”</p>

<p>“Only a little way,” said the Bear. And,
rising from the stump, he led the way up the
road.</p>

<small>THE WEE BEAR’S BIRTHDAY PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Pray, what do you have for servants?”
asked the Donkey, as they crossed a brook and
struck up a little hill.</p>

<p>“Coons,” the Bear replied. “They make
the best.”</p>

<p>“If they weren’t so lazy and shiftless,” said
the Donkey.</p>

<p>“They <i>are</i> lazy,” the Bear admitted. “I
have to keep poking them up all the time; but
it doesn’t do much good.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you would need six servants,”
Buddie spoke up. What could a bear
without a family want with so many?</p>

<p>“Well, I <i>hired</i> only one,” said the Bear,
“and he got five others to do the work. He
won’t do a thing himself; though he does condescend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
to wait on table when there’s company.”</p>

<p>“He must get pretty high wages to be able
to hire five assistants,” remarked the Donkey.</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t <i>pay</i> them anything. He
just boards and sleeps them—at my expense.”
The Bear sighed in a resigned sort of way.
Evidently the case was hopeless.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t stand it!” Buddie declared. It
was a shame to impose on such good nature.</p>

<p>“I have to grin and bear it,” was the reply.
“That’s the motto of our family: Grin and
Bear It.”</p>

<p>“And a very good motto it is,” said the
Donkey. “Now, you never see a bear without
a grin.”</p>

<p>“So Doctor Goose says,” said the Bear.
“He claims the bear came first and the grin
afterward. But Doctor Fox claims the grin
came first. Otherwise, he says, the motto
would be, Bear and Grin It.”</p>

<p>“What difference does it make?” said Buddie.</p>

<p>“Not a mite, that I can see,” said the Bear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
“I have to grin, and I have to bear it. But
to hear Doctor Fox and Doctor Goose go on,
you would think it was the most important matter
in the world. Here we are.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="The Bear calling out to Sam"></div>

<p>The Bear drew aside a bush that screened
the entrance to a cave, and called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Sam! O Sam! Where are you, Sam?”</p>

<p>A sound of shuffling feet came from the interior,
and presently the Oldest Coon made his
appearance, rubbing his eyes as if he had just
wakened from a nap. But at sight of the Donkey
and Buddie he straightened up and put on
an air of great dignity.</p>

<p>“Step this way, please,” he said with a
grand bow, and led the way inside.</p>

<p>First was a long and dimly-lighted corridor,
which ended, the Bear said, in a reception-room.
From this came a clatter of small talk,
and Buddie was curious to learn who the talkers
were; but before they reached the reception-room,
the Oldest Coon bowed them into a
smaller apartment that opened off the corridor.
This, the Bear informed them, was his den.</p>

<p>“You can hang up your hat and wraps here,”
he said to Buddie.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t any hat and wraps,” said
she; “and it’s just as well, as I don’t see any
place to hang them.” For there wasn’t a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
stick of furniture in the room or a hook on the
wall.</p>

<p>“It’s certainly a <i>bear</i> place,” said the Donkey,
hee-hawing at his own joke.</p>

<p>“I mean to have a hall-tree,” the Bear apologized;
“but I can’t decide on the kind to get.
Doctor Goose advises birch, but Doctor Fox
claims poplar is the best. All the newest things,
he says, are <i>poplar</i>.”</p>

<p>“What’s a hall-tree?” inquired Buddie.
There was no such thing in her home.</p>

<p>“A hall-tree,” the Donkey explained, “is a
tree that grows in the hall, just as a shade-tree
is a tree that grows in the shade. The trouble
with birch and poplar”—turning to the Bear—“is
that they grow so fast you have to keep lopping
them off, unless your hall is very high,
and this one isn’t.”</p>

<p>“I must see about those thistles,” said the
Bear, and hurried away. But he was back in a
moment. “I forgot to tell you we dress for
dinner,” he said, and was off again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“I always carry a dinner-coat with me,” said
the Donkey, and from one of his saddle-bags he
drew out a remarkable jacket in red and green
checks, embroidered all over with Scotch thistles.</p>

<p>“I forgot to say,” said the Bear, again poking
his head inside the den, “it’s to be a birthday
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Whose?” cried Buddie. But the Bear was
out of hearing. “Let me help you,” she said
to the Donkey, who was making such awkward
work of getting into his dinner-coat that she
scarcely could keep from laughing.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he replied. “It <i>is</i> a little
hard to manage. How do I look? There isn’t
a glass in the room.”</p>

<p>“Very fine indeed,” Buddie assured him.
And then it suddenly occurred to her that <i>she</i>
had no dinner-coat, and she wondered what she
should do.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Donkey. “<i>You’re</i> dressed
already. Shall we go in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>The Oldest Coon was waiting at the entrance
to the reception-room to announce them.</p>

<p>“Professor Bray!” he called out pompously,
as the Donkey passed in. “Your name,
please?”—turning to Buddie.</p>

<p>“Just Buddie,” she replied in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Just Buddie!” announced the Oldest Coon.
And Buddie found herself in a large high room,
almost round, in which was assembled as queer
a company, Little One, as ever you saw in a
picture-book, or out. The one familiar face
was that of the Rabbit. He wore a white cut-away
coat and a large pink cravat, and he was
talking to a Little Small Wee Bear, who was
dressed in a blue reefer, with a sash of the same
color. And Buddie guessed it was the Wee
Bear’s birthday party, as all the other guests
were grouped about her and paying her many
small attentions.</p>

<p>The other guests were a Middle Bear (who,
as Buddie afterward learned, was the mother
of the Wee Bear and the sister of the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Huge Bear), a Porcupine, an Owl and a Loon.
The Middle Bear wore a long linen duster,
which didn’t fit her any too well, and the Owl
a snug-fitting jersey of what looked suspiciously
like mouse-skin; the Loon wore a tightly-fitting
mackintosh, and the Porcupine had decided on
an Eton jacket as an appropriate dress for dinner.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_098.jpg" alt="Rabbit talking with Small Wee Bear"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“I wonder how he ever got that on over his
quills,” Buddie said to herself. She had seen
porcupines before. They came lumbering
round the log house in the most sociable way,
and chewed up ax-handles, barn-doors and
other woody delicacies. And Buddie recalled
one exciting day when Colonel came home with
his nose and mouth filled with quills. How he
did howl when her father pulled them out with
a pair of pincers!</p>

<p>Buddie wished she might slip into a corner
and watch the others; but the Rabbit came hurrying
over to introduce her to the company,
and presently Buddie found herself telling the
Wee Bear she was ever so glad to meet her,
and the Wee Bear was telling her, in return,
that she was just one year old and was having
<i>such</i> a nice birthday party.</p>

<p>“Do you go to kindergarten?” asked the
Wee Bear.</p>

<p>Now, would you believe it, Little One? Buddie
had never even heard the word before, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
the Middle Bear had to explain that a kindergarten
was a place where children were taught,
without their knowing it, the most remarkable
things. Wee Bears were taught to eat honey;
rabbits, to hold up their ears when listening
intently; squirrels, to crack nuts, and so on.
The fishes took the water course, and learned
from a wise old Trout how to breathe under
water and how to move their fins. For the
feathered tribe there was a venerable Bat, who
gave instruction in twigonometry and all the
other branches of treeology.</p>

<p>“There were no kindergartens when I was
young,” concluded the Middle Bear, “and I
have often wondered how I managed to learn
the way to eat honey.”</p>

<p>“This week,” chimed in the Wee Bear, “I
am learning to pick blueberries.”</p>

<p>“The best of it is,” said the Middle Bear,
“these nature studies take the little ones out of
doors, where there is plenty of fresh air and
sky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Just then Buddie discovered that the Porcupine,
who was sitting beside the Wee Bear, had
quills as soft and silky as the fur on a kitten’s
back.</p>

<p>“He’s a Fretless Porcupine,” said the Middle
Bear, when she whispered that she had never
seen quills of that sort before. “He never frets,
no matter what happens.”</p>

<p>Buddie did not see what fretting had to do
with quills; and before she had a chance to inquire,
the Donkey came along to pay his respects
to the Wee Bear and her mother.</p>

<p>As Buddie was not used to “going out in
company,” she hardly knew what to say, other
than “Yes” or “No,” when some one of the
guests addressed a question to her, which
wasn’t often. Fortunately they paid very little
attention to her, so she was able to sit and listen
to the chatter around her.</p>

<p>Not so the Donkey. He moved about with
the ease of one accustomed to polite society,
dropping a compliment here and a joke there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
wishing the Wee Bear many happy returns of
the day, and congratulating the Rabbit on the
fit of his coat.</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll have dinner soon,” Buddie
thought. “I’m dreadfully hungry.”</p>

<p>She could hear a bustle in the room she took
to be the kitchen; and presently she caught
sight of one of the Coons struggling into it with
a big basket of Scotch thistles.</p>

<p>“There goes <i>your</i> dinner,” she whispered to
the Donkey. “Now, perhaps, they’ll ring the
bell.”</p>

<p>“They’re waiting for Doctor Fox and Doctor
Goose,” said the Donkey.</p>

<p>At that moment loud voices were heard in
the hall. As they came nearer Buddie caught
such phrases as “I deny it,” “Nothing of the
sort,” “The grin came first,” “Stuff and nonsense!”—all
jumbled up together; and the two
Doctors came into the room.</p>

<p>A queer-looking pair they were: both wore
long black coats and tall hats, and on the nose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
of each (provided, of course, that a goose has a
nose) was a pair of spectacles. Doctor Goose
was waving his wings and Doctor Fox his paws,
and both were talking at the tops of their voices.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="Doctor Fox and Doctor Goose"></div>

<p>“They’re at it again,” said the Great Huge
Bear, who had followed them in.</p>

<p>“I say the bear came first,” shouted Doctor
Goose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Nothing of the sort,” shouted Doctor Fox.
“The grin—”</p>

<p>The controversy was happily interrupted by
the Oldest Coon, who thrust his head inside the
room and bawled out:</p>

<p>“<i>Dinner!</i>”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>A LONG DISPUTE ENDED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Such a queer company called for a queer
table. This was long and narrow, and the
dishes were placed all on one side. Steps led
up to the other side for the waiters to ascend,
for not one of the Coons was tall enough, even
when he stood on tiptoes, to reach the top of
the table from the floor.</p>

<p>The three Bears sat in the middle, with Buddie
on the right and the Donkey on the left;
and, in order to “keep peace in the family,”
as the saying goes, Doctor Fox had been seated
at one end of the table and Doctor Goose at the
other. But, as we shall see, this arrangement
did not long keep them from quarreling.</p>

<p>It was strictly a vegetarian dinner, and no
two guests, except the Bears, had the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
thing to eat. The Bears, of course, had porridge.
There was a big bowl of it for the Great
Huge Bear, a middle-sized bowl for the Middle
Bear, and a wee bowl for the Little Small Wee
Bear.</p>

<p>“And I suppose,” thought Buddie, “the
Great Hooge Bear’s porridge would be too hot
for me, and the Middle Bear’s too cold, and
the Little Small Wee Bear’s just right. Goodness!
Aren’t they going to give <i>me</i> anything
to eat?” She had suddenly discovered that her
plate was empty.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what you liked,” said the
Great Huge Bear, “so I thought I’d let you
order.”</p>

<p>Buddie was much embarrassed. For one
thing, everybody stopped talking and watched
her curiously; and for another, she hadn’t the
least idea what to ask for, except porridge, and
she didn’t like that very well.</p>

<p>“Order anything you like,” said the Great
Huge Bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Some porridge, please,” Buddie at last decided.
Porridge would be better than nothing.</p>

<p>“Sam!” called the Great Huge Bear.</p>

<p>“Yessir!” replied the Oldest Coon, running
up on the table.</p>

<p>“A bowl of porridge for Just Buddie.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no more porridge,” said the
Oldest Coon.</p>

<p>“Anything else?” inquired the Great Huge
Bear, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Have you any meat and potatoes?” Buddie
asked the Oldest Coon, who again shook
his head.</p>

<p>“Well, what <i>have</i> you got?” asked Buddie.
The Great Huge Bear meant well, no doubt,
but evidently his pantry was not stocked with
things that little girls like.</p>

<p>“Honey and blueberries?” suggested Sam.</p>

<p>“Goody!” cried Buddie; and the Oldest
Coon fetched a big dishful. And you may be
sure they were good, Little One, for bears are
great judges of honey and blueberries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>When every one had finished dinner the
Donkey rapped on the table and announced
that, by request, he wished to make a short
speech.</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” shrieked the Loon, and
Buddie, who sat next him, jumped.</p>

<p>“Birds and quadrupeds,” began the Donkey
(this wasn’t exactly the equivalent for “Ladies
and gentlemen,” but it did very well), “I propose
a toast in honor of the charming young
person whose birthday we have gathered to
celebrate, the Little Small Wee Bear.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” shrieked the Loon, and
Buddie jumped again.</p>

<p>“We <i>can’t</i> hear if you don’t keep quiet,”
she said sharply.</p>

<p>“May she have many happy returns of this
happy, happy day,” went on the Donkey,
“and may the troubles she must grin and bear
be few and far between.”</p>

<p>This speech was received with loud cheering,
which ended in a dispute between the rival
Doctors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“Bear and grin!” Doctor Fox shouted down
the table.</p>

<p>“Grin and bear!” Doctor Goose shouted
back.</p>

<p>“I leave it to my learned friend,” said Doctor
Fox, appealing to the Donkey.</p>

<p>“Who shall decide when doctors disagree?”
said the Donkey, wagging his head.</p>

<p>“Suppose <i>you</i> decide!” cried both the Doctors
in a breath.</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” shrieked the excited Loon,
and everybody leaned forward to watch the
Donkey.</p>

<p>He seemed to feel the importance of his position.
He put on a very thoughtful look, pursed
up his lips and wrinkled his brows. You would
hardly believe, Little One, that a donkey could
look so wise.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” he said at last, “that the
question, Which came first, the bear or the
grin? is very much the same as that other problem,
Which came first, the hen or the egg?”</p>

<p>“That’s it! Which did?” cried the Doctors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“That,” replied the Donkey, “is not to be
answered offhand. No question in metaphysics
<i>can</i> be. Truth, as you know, lies at the bottom
of a well, and the deeper the question the deeper
the well. Such a simple problem as why a rabbit
wabbles his nose, or why hair does not grow
on the inside of a skull instead of the outside,
or why a fly rubs his forelegs together, lies on
the surface of the Well of Truth, and may be
skimmed off; but problems like the one we are
now considering lie deep down, and a long rope
and a stout bucket are needed to fetch up the
answer.”</p>

<p>“Precisely!” exclaimed the Doctors, trembling
with excitement.</p>

<p>“Which came first, the hen or the egg?
Wise men and donkeys have debated the question
for centuries, but, so far as I know, it never
before has been settled.” The Donkey paused,
and for a moment seemed lost in thought.</p>

<p>“So!” thought Buddie. “It’s going to be
settled <i>now</i>; that’s certain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“At first glance,” went on the Donkey, “it
would seem that the hen came first. Such is
the opinion of my learned friend, Doctor Long-ears.
For, he says, if there had been no hen
to set on the eggs—”</p>

<p>“Sit,” corrected Doctor Fox.</p>

<p>“Set,” contradicted Doctor Goose.</p>

<p>“If there had been no hen to <i>hatch</i> the egg,”
continued the Donkey, skilfully avoiding a fresh
dispute, “the egg experiment must have come
to a sudden end.”</p>

<p>“My opinion exactly!” declared Doctor
Goose.</p>

<p>“These are the <i>conclusions</i> of Doctor Long-ears.
His argument, as written, fills three
large books.”</p>

<p>“With pictures?” asked Buddie.</p>

<p>“Without pictures.”</p>

<p>“They must be stupid books,” thought Buddie.</p>

<p>“On the other hand,” resumed the Donkey,
“Doctor Heehaw, another learned donkey of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
my acquaintance, proves just as conclusively
that the egg came first. For, he asks, if there
had been no egg for the hen to hatch, what
was the use of the hen? You may say that the
egg may have hatched without the hen. I reply:
suppose it had hatched out a rooster?”</p>

<p>“What then?” asked Doctor Fox, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Um!” replied the Donkey. “To sum up
the arguments: if the hen came first, it presupposes
the existence of the egg; whereas, if the
egg came first, it presupposes the existence of
the hen—neither of which presuppositions
agrees with the other in gender, number or
case.”</p>

<p>“Nothing could be clearer,” cried both Doctors.</p>

<p>“Therefore, in the matter of bear and grin,
as of hen and egg, I firmly believe—I always
have believed—and nothing I may hereafter
read, hear or think can alter my opinion—that
<span class="allsmcap">BOTH CAME TOGETHER</span>!”</p>

<p>Even Buddie joined in the applause that followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
this remarkable decision, which put an
end to the dispute for all time. The rival Doctors
embraced each other, exclaiming, “Why
didn’t <i>we</i> think of that?” and everybody congratulated
the Donkey upon his profound wisdom
and clear reasoning. And, to do him justice,
he accepted the praise with uncommon
modesty.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>What is that, Little One? Didn’t the hen lay
the egg? Very likely. But I shouldn’t think
any more about it, if I were you. A great
many grown-ups have puzzled over this problem
until their minds became a perfect jumble
of eggs and hens, and their brains turned into
omelets. After all, the Donkey’s explanation
is as good as another’s; and I am not at all
sure it isn’t the right one.</p>

<small>THE FLIGHT OF THE LOON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Maybe you would like to sing something?”
the Great Huge Bear said to the Donkey.
“You do sing so beautifully.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” was the response, “if you
will despatch one of the servants for my lute....
And now,”—when the lute was fetched—“what
shall it be?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sammy Patch</i>,” whispered Buddie.</p>

<p>“You know I’m tired of that song,” protested
the Donkey. Nevertheless he sang it,
and was roundly applauded. Then, to oblige
the Great Huge Bear, he sang <i>The Land of
Nod</i>, and with such skill that the Bear dozed
off into one of his half-sleeps.</p>

<p>As to the next song, Doctor Fox and Doctor
Goose fell into a fresh wrangle. One wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
<i>Doctor Foster</i> and the other called for <i>Jack
and Jill</i>.</p>

<p>“Sing both of them,” giggled the Owl. But
this suggestion didn’t help matters much, as
each Doctor demanded that <i>his</i> favorite song
be sung first. At last the Donkey, who had a
positive genius for settling disputes, sang both
songs in this fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Doctor Foster went to Gloucester,</div>
<div class="indent">To fetch a pail of water.</div>
<div class="verse">He stepped in a puddle up to his middle,</div>
<div class="indent">And Jill came tumbling after.</div>
<div class="verse">Then Jack and Jill went up a hill</div>
<div class="indent">In a shower of rain.</div>
<div class="verse">Jack fell down and broke his crown,</div>
<div class="indent">And never went there again.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“The Loon sings very well,” said the Rabbit,
when the Donkey suggested that somebody
else might wish to favor the company. “Sing
us that ballad called <i>If</i>, old fellow.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear it,” said the Donkey,
and courteously offered the use of his lute. But
the Loon declined it, saying that he always
sang without music, which, it turned out, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
no more than the truth; for the noise he made
could hardly be called music. And besides, as
Buddie said, there wasn’t any sense to the
words. However, this was the Loon’s song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“If thistles grew on plum-trees,</div>
<div class="indent">And plums were wayside flowers,</div>
<div class="indent2">We’d trudge along together,</div>
<div class="indent2">And never mind the weather,</div>

<div class="indent">To pluck in April showers—</div>

<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent">Of things both hot and cool—</div>
<div class="verse">If you were wise as could be,</div>
<div class="indent">And I an April fool.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“May I ask,” the Donkey inquired politely,
“what method of singing you use?”</p>

<p>“Great fish! I haven’t any,” replied the
Loon. “I just sing.”</p>

<p>“I mean, how do you sing ‘Ah’?”</p>

<p>“I don’t sing ‘Ah.’ I sing ‘Hoo-Wooooo-wooooo!’”</p>

<p>“That is certainly a loony method,” remarked
the Donkey.</p>

<p>“It suits me,” returned the other; and he
nudged the Owl. “Come, suppose <i>you</i> give
us a song.”</p>

<p>“Oh, la! I haven’t sung for years,” tittered
the Owl.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Spoke up the rabbit. “I heard
you only last week. Give us <i>I can not sing
the owl songs I sung long years ago</i>.”</p>

<p>“But if he <i>can’t</i> sing them there’s no sense
in his trying,” said the Donkey. “My ear
is so sensitive,” he added, in the ear of the
Great Huge Bear, “that an untrained voice
grates on it fearfully.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“What’s the row?” asked the Great Huge
Bear, sleepily. And as nobody told him he
dozed off again.</p>

<p>“Suppose we hear from Just Buddie,” said
the Middle Bear. She spoke but seldom, and
always to some purpose.</p>

<p>The suggestion met with entire favor, and
again Buddie was much embarrassed. As before,
everybody stopped talking and turned his
eyes upon her. Even the Great Huge Bear,
when awakened and informed that Just Buddie
was going to sing, appeared greatly interested.</p>

<p>Now you, Little One, who go to kindergarten
and learn so many pretty songs, will be
surprised to hear that Buddie did not know a
single song she could sing “in company.”
Music was almost unknown in the log house by
the lake. Indeed, she had heard more songs
this very day than ever she had heard before;
but these, even, were so jumbled up in her
mind that, with the possible exception of
<i>Sammy Patch</i>, she could not remember two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
successive lines of any one of them; and even
if she <i>had</i> been able to remember them, they
had been sung once, and the company wanted
something new. Suddenly she thought of the
Yellow Dog’s song, <i>Nobody Knows</i>. Perhaps
they hadn’t heard that.</p>

<p>“I’ll accompany you on the lute, if you
wish,” offered the Donkey.</p>

<p>“Have you heard <i>Nobody Knows</i>?”
Buddie asked. The question was addressed to
the Rabbit particularly.</p>

<p>He nodded brightly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said he; “but I don’t think the
others have heard it.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I never have,” said the Donkey.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said the Middle Bear.</p>

<p>“I can’t seem to remember the first line,”
said Buddie. “There were so many verses, and
all the lines were so much alike.”</p>

<p>“It begins ‘<i>We know</i>—’” prompted the
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“I thought the song was called <i>Nobody
Knows</i>,” the Owl tittered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Silence!” said the Middle Bear. “Go on,
Just Buddie.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try,” she said; and she began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“We know why a peach is all covered with fuzz,</div>
<div class="indent">While a fig is as flat as a floor;</div>
<div class="verse">We know why a fire won’t burn when it does,</div>
<div class="indent">And why three and seven are four—”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“That doesn’t sound just right,” she said,
with an appealing glance at the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“It sounds all right to me,” said the Middle
Bear. “Please continue.” So Buddie, though
still doubtful, went on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“We know why green peas and potatoes won’t jell,</div>
<div class="indent">Why peanuts are relished by crows;</div>
<div class="verse">But no one, I’m sure, has been able to tell</div>
<div class="indent">Why a rabbit must wabble his nose.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“I’m <i>sure</i> that isn’t right,” said Buddie.
“Anyway, I know how the Chorus goes.” The
Rabbit knew, too, and he joined in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“WE’VE WHISPERED IT SO YOU COULD HEAR IT FOR MILES;</div>
<div class="verse"><small>We’ve shouted it ‘under the rose’.”</small></div>
</div></div>

<p>At this point a curious thing happened. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Loon burst
into hysterical
laughter, and,
springing into the air, went whizzing round
the room in gradually narrowing circles, wheeling
higher with each turn. Buddie followed
him with her eyes.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_122a.jpg" alt="Loon flying"></div>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_122b.jpg" alt="Buddie watching Loon"></div>

<p>“He’ll have to stop when he gets to the ceiling,”
she thought.</p>

<p>But the ceiling rose
with the Loon, and
it grew brighter and
brighter, until at last
the sky appeared. Up
and up wheeled the
Loon, until
he became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
a mere speck in the blue, and disappeared
altogether. Then Buddie looked down—</p>

<p>But the Bear’s house, and the Bears, and
the Donkey, and all the others, had vanished
with the Loon, and she was again in Beavertown.
Everything was as she had left it, except
that the Laziest Beaver no longer fanned
himself with his tail; he had fallen asleep.
But the Yellow Dog, apparently as fresh as
ever, was finishing the Chorus which Buddie
had begun and the Loon had interrupted.</p>

<p>And, as before, there came the peculiar
echoes around Buddie’s head; but this time she
kept her eyes fixed on the Yellow Dog.</p>

<p>“Every time I look up,” she thought, “I
am carried off to somewhere else. And I
want to stay a little while and talk to Colonel.”</p>

<p>The experiment succeeded beautifully. The
echoes floated away, but the meadow and the
little river remained; the Laziest Beaver slept
beside his tumble-down house, and the Yellow
Dog began another verse of his seemingly endless
song:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“We know why two birds may be killed with one stone,</div>
<div class="indent">While it’s hard to kill one bird with two;</div>
<div class="verse">Why a sunshiny shower won’t last half an hour,</div>
<div class="indent">Is a cud that is easy to chew;</div>
<div class="verse">Why horseshoes are good to keep witches away,</div>
<div class="indent">Is too simple by far to propose;</div>
<div class="verse">But no one can tell—we must ask of The Well—</div>

<div class="indent4">His-no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ose—’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“I’ll look up just the least little bit,” said
Buddie to herself, when the echoes again came
flying around her head. But no sooner did
she raise her eyes than, as before, the sky
broke into little patches and the tree-tops ran
together. She looked back quickly—but it
was too late! Just a glimpse of the Laziest
Beaver’s tail as the scene shifted, and she
found herself, as she had expressed it, “somewhere
else.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>“MARY’S LITTLE LAMB”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>As far as Buddie could see in either direction
stretched a wide, straight road, bordered with
small firs and floored with springy moss. In
winter this road, which had been made by lumbermen,
was smooth and level; in the spring
it was all water, for it ran through a swamp;
but as summer advanced it gradually dried out
and made a very pleasant highway for little
girls, who seldom or never came there, and for
the people of the wood, who used it a great
deal. Both sides of the road were white with
the blossoms of Enchanter’s Nightshade; but
as Buddie had seen no other flower since she
entered the wood, she had grown rather tired
of it, and would have welcomed a little variety.</p>

<p>“I wish these were violets,” she said, picking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
another bouquet. “Violets are prettier
and smell nicer. Why, they <i>are</i> violets!” she
continued, surprised and delighted to find that
not only the blossoms in her hand, but those
along the road had changed into her favorite
flower—blue and white and yellow.</p>

<p>So she rambled along, gathering violets until
her two hands could hold no more. And
presently she began to wish she might see
some roses. Violets are pretty and sweet, but
one can get too much even of violets, don’t you
think, Little One? Anyhow, Buddie thought
so, and she wished again, out loud (for that is
the only way to wish if you expect your wish
to come true), that the violets were roses. And
behold, they <i>were</i> roses! The swamp road
was gay with them.</p>

<p>Luckily Buddie did not suspect that these
wonders proceeded from the bouquet of Enchanter’s
Nightshade, now forgotten, which
was fastened in her hair; for had she wished it
were something else, only to throw it away
after it had become a bouquet of violets and
roses, her adventures would have come to a
sudden end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">AND BEHOLD, THEY <span class="u">WERE</span> ROSES</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>She was not long exhausting the list of flowers
she knew. Promptly at her wish the roses
became harebells, the harebells became daisies,
the daisies became marsh marigolds, and so on,
until she could no longer think of a new flower
to wish for. I think it was nice of her to be
content with flowers, don’t you? She might
have wished for candy, or oranges; or, as all
the trees along the road were Christmas trees,
she might have wished them decorated with
toys and sweets. I am not at all sure she
would have resisted the temptation if it had
come to her; nor that such wishes would have
come true. All I can tell you is, she was quite
satisfied with the flowers, and walked for a
long way before she got tired of the wishing
game.</p>

<p>At first it was a relief to be alone in the
wood—there had been so much talking and
singing, and such a deal going on; but after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
while Buddie began to think it would be pleasant
to meet some of her wood friends again.
There was her engagement with the Rabbit,
who was to escort her to the Greenwood Club.
What if it were past two o’clock, and the Rabbit
had tired of waiting for her at the Corner,
wherever that might be? One can tell time,
the Donkey had said, by the way it flies, as
one can tell a sandpiper or a crow; but he had
neglected to explain just how to do it. No
doubt time was flying—it always is; but Buddie,
looking up at the blue sky, could make
nothing of time’s flight.</p>

<p>While she was puzzling over this matter,
which a grown-up would have found difficult,
she came to a place where the roads forked, or,
rather, where two roads met; for when a road
forks, the tines of the fork should be smaller
than the handle; but these roads were of the
same width, and as like as two peas. However,
there was no doubt which she should take,
for there was a sign-board that read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p><img src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="hand pointing right"> &#160; THIS WAY TO THE CORNER</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>I don’t know who put up the sign-board,
Little One. Since Buddie told me her story I
have been over the swamp road, but I saw
nothing of a sign-board, although everything
else was as she described it, even to the very
tall Christmas tree that stood just where the
two roads came together.</p>

<p>The hand on the sign-board pointed up the
right road, and Buddie was reminded of the
Rabbit’s directions for putting back the Guinea-Pig’s
eyes: whichever one you choose first is
<i>right</i>. But after she had walked another long
way the Corner seemed as far off as ever. As
the road was perfectly straight she could see
ahead for a long distance, and there was no
sign of anything that looked like a corner.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I should know it if I came
to it,” she thought. The Rabbit had not explained
what sort of corner it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Was that something moving up the road?
Yes, it was; and it was coming her way.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a lamb!” she cried, when it
drew nearer. “But is
it a lamb? It’s black,
and lambs are white.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="Black Lamb"></div>

<p>But it <i>was</i> a lamb,
nevertheless, and a remarkably
self-possessed and easy-going lamb,
too; not the sort that runs about bleating,
scared out of its wits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span></p>

<p>“I’m very well, thank you,” said the Lamb,
before Buddie had a chance to ask, “How do
you do?”</p>

<p>“No; most lambs have black fleece,” continued
the Lamb, anticipating another question.
“I had an elder brother who was different:
he was the white sheep of the family. We
seldom speak of him. Yes; I know what you
are thinking of; but Mary’s Little Lamb died
years ago. You may recite it if you wish.”</p>

<p>Buddie could not help doing so; for the old
jingle had come into her head and insisted on
getting out again. So she began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Mary had a little lamb</div>
<div class="indent">Whose fleece was white as snow;</div>
<div class="verse">And everywhere that Mary went,</div>
<div class="indent">The lamb was sure to go.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“That’s not the way I learned it,” the
Lamb interrupted. “Try another verse.”</p>

<p>Buddie went on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“He followed her to school one day,</div>
<div class="indent">Which was against the rule,</div>

<div class="first">“And so the teacher turned him out,</div>
<div class="indent">But still he lingered near,</div>

<div class="indent">The eager children cry.</div>
<div class="verse">‘Oh, Mary loves the lamb, you know,’</div>
<div class="indent">The teacher did reply.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“That’s all I know,” said Buddie.</p>

<p>“Try to forget it,” advised the Lamb. “It’s
all nonsense, especially that part about the
school. Now, this is the way it really goes:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>This was not the version Buddie had learned,
though perhaps it was the way the story <i>ought</i>
to go. It really was too much to believe that
<i>everywhere</i> that Mary went the Lamb was sure
to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Meantime the Black Lamb had moved along,
cropping the wild mint that grew along the
road, as much as to say: “That will give you
something to think about until you see me
again.”</p>

<p>“Before you go,” said Buddie, “I wish you
would tell me where the Corner is.”</p>

<p>“There’s a sign right in front of your nose,”
said the Lamb, saucily. Eating mint always
makes a Lamb saucy.</p>

<p>Sure enough; tacked on a tree was another
sign-board:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p><img src="images/i_135.jpg" alt="hand pointing left"> &#160; THIS WAY TO THE CORNER</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was exactly like the first, except that the
hand pointed <i>down</i> the road.</p>

<p>“Why, I must have passed the Corner,”
said Buddie. “Could you tell me—”</p>

<p>But the Lamb had disappeared. Doubtless
he had wandered in among the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="Buddie and the Stork"></div>

<p>Something else was in
sight, however. Away
down the road was a
large bird, and Buddie hastened toward it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“It’s a crane,” she said. “No; it’s a heron.
No; it’s a—” <i>What</i> was it?</p>

<p>Closer inspection proved it to be neither
heron nor crane, for it was white, with black-tipped
wings, and it had a certain grand manner
about it foreign to cranes and herons.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what it is now!” cried Buddie.
“It’s a stork.”</p>

<p>The Stork turned his head slowly as Buddie
approached, and regarded her with a most
amiable expression.</p>

<p>“It isn’t so,” he remarked, before she could
frame a question. “I never carried one in my
life.”</p>

<p>“Never carried one what?” asked Buddie.</p>

<p>“Baby,” said the Stork.</p>

<small>“ONE FROM TWO LEAVES FOUR”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“You see,” said the Stork, “in the first
place I <i>couldn’t</i> carry a baby; and in the
second place, I <i>wouldn’t</i> if I could. I think
that disposes of the matter.”</p>

<p>There was no reason for the show of impatience
that accompanied the disclaimer, as
Buddie had said nothing about storks carrying
babies and hadn’t intended to say anything, for
the very good reason that she had never heard
they did.</p>

<p>“The least reflection,” went on the Stork,
although the matter had been disposed of,
“will convince any one of the absurdity of the
idea. I don’t know exactly how many storks
there are in the world—the new census isn’t
out yet; but I know there are so many more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
babies than storks that we simply couldn’t
handle the business, even if we had nothing
else to do; and we <i>have</i> other things to do, I
can assure you. Besides, I couldn’t carry
such heavy bundles. Besides, I hate carrying
bundles—it’s so vulgar. Besides—what are
you staring at? Is there anything wrong about
me?”</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> something wrong about him; precisely
what, Buddie was trying to make out.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” she suddenly burst out.
“You’re standing on both legs.”</p>

<p>“So are you,” retorted the Stork; “but I
don’t gawk at you as if you were a freak.”</p>

<p>“But I’m supposed to, and you’re not,”
said Buddie.</p>

<p>“Well, I like that,” said the Stork, though
it was easy to see he didn’t. “What are legs
for—to keep off the sun, like a parasol?”</p>

<p>Buddie felt that she was in another losing
argument, but she stood by her small guns.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen storks before,” said she; “not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
real live ones, you know, but in a picture-book;
and they all stood on one leg, and
looked—” She paused. Just how did they
look?</p>

<p>“Foolish?” hazarded the Stork.</p>

<p>“Just like <i>four</i>,” said Buddie.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” remarked the Stork. “I’ve
heard about looking like <i>sixty</i>, but never like
<i>four</i>. And pray, how must one get one’s self
up to look like <i>four</i>? I am curious to know.”</p>

<p>“You would have to hold up one leg,” said
Buddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, one from two leaves four, does it?”
said the Stork. “That’s a new kind of arithmetic.”</p>

<p>I think, Little One, that Buddie’s explanation
was scarcely clear enough. A stork looks
like four when he is wading,—stalking his
game,—at which time he lifts one foot slowly
and puts it down very carefully; but when he is
resting he has to look like <i>one</i> or <i>eleven</i>.</p>

<p>“I’m too old to begin gymnastics,” went on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
the Stork, as Buddie remained silent. “You
can’t teach an old stork new tricks. Though I
dare say I could stand on one leg if I tried.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be very smart if you
couldn’t,” said Buddie, tartly. The bird had a
most provoking air about him.</p>

<p>“Tut! tut! I’m old enough, child, to be
your grandfather. We’ll see about this gymnastic
business.”</p>

<p>So saying, the stork lifted one leg, and attempted
to balance on the other; but, to Buddie’s
great delight he fell ingloriously on his
head, his long bill running into the soft ground
like a fork into a well-done potato.</p>

<p>It isn’t polite to laugh at one old enough to
be your grandfather; so Buddie checked her
glee and ran to help the unfortunate bird to
rise.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly,” he said, declining assistance,
and making a great clatter with his bill,
as all storks do when excited or angry. “Don’t
be silly. You’ll be teaching a fish to swim
next.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>A second and third attempt to stand on one
leg met with no better success than the first, the
Stork falling first one way and then another,
and all the time working himself into an extremely
bad temper.</p>

<p>“Perhaps if you leaned against a tree you
could do it,” Buddie ventured to advise.</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad idea,” said the Stork,
slightly mollified; and he proceeded to put the
idea into effect, with entire success. “Now,
then,” said he, “take the tree away and see if
I can stand alone.”</p>

<p>“I can’t take the tree away,” demurred
Buddie; “but you can lean against me, if you
like, and when you’re ready I’ll walk off.”</p>

<p>“That’s another good idea,” approved the
Stork. “But don’t walk far, as I might fall
before you returned.”</p>

<p>So Buddie placed her hands against the
bird’s side and steadied him while he drew up
one leg; and when she thought he was properly
balanced she stepped back a little. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Stork, like Jill, came tumbling after, and Buddie
had to push him back. This operation was
repeated a dozen times, until Buddie’s patience
was exhausted and her arms were tired.</p>

<p>“If you began by holding up your foot just a
little way,” said she, “you could put it down
as quick as a wink when you felt yourself falling.”</p>

<p>“That’s the best idea yet,” said the bird.
“We’ll rest a bit, and go at it again later.”</p>

<p>The Stork’s idea of resting was to plant himself
firmly on both legs, with his feet wide
apart and one foot a little in advance of the
other. Standing thus there was no danger of
falling. But Buddie’s notion of a breathing-spell
was quite different. She sat down in the
grass with her chin on her knees and her hands
clasped around them.</p>

<p>“So I look like <i>four</i> in your picture-book?”
remarked the Stork. Buddie nodded. “It’s
ridiculous to put such books in the hands of
children. It gives them false ideas of natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
history. They’re as bad as fairy tales; and
I’d no more give a fairy tale to a child of mine
than I’d stand on my head.”</p>

<p>“You came near standing on your head a
little while ago,” said Buddie, mischievously.
The Stork ignored the remark, and continued:</p>

<p>“Take the story of <i>The Three Bears</i>. I
dare say you’ve read that.”</p>

<p>Buddie nodded eagerly.</p>

<p>“I like that story best of all,” said she.</p>

<p>“I suspected as much,” returned the Stork,
severely. “It’s a most immoral story, much
worse than the stories about cutting off giants’
heads. There is no danger of a child growing
up with an ambition to cut off a giant’s head,
because, in the first place, there are no more
giants, and, in the second place, if there were
there’d be a law against it; but there <i>is</i> danger
in letting children believe that it isn’t wrong to
steal a bear’s porridge, and break his chair,
and muss up his bed, as Goldenhair did.”</p>

<p>“It’s not so in <i>my</i> story book,” Buddie protested.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
“It was a naughty old woman who
ate the bear’s porridge.”</p>

<p>“You must have a new version,” said the
Stork. “It was time they did something about
that story; it was making criminals of children
every day. And how about <i>Jack and the
Beanstalk</i>? It was a fine thing for Jack to
steal the giant’s bag of gold, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“He was a wicked giant, and Jack’s mother
was dreadfully poor,” said Buddie.</p>

<p>“Hoighty, toighty!” cried the Stork. “That’s
a nice excuse, isn’t it? What do you expect
will become of you, child?”</p>

<p>This was a hard question, which Buddie did
not attempt to answer, and the Stork went on,
in the same scolding tone:</p>

<p>“Then those ridiculous stories about dragons.
Why do little boys torture cats, and little girls
pull bluebottle flies to pieces?” Buddie couldn’t
say. “Because they like to pretend that cats
and bluebottle flies are dragons, and they’re
pulling them to pieces for the good of the country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Why do little girls like pretty dresses and
new hair-ribbons?” Buddie had never analyzed
this natural desire. “Because their heads are
full of nonsense about princesses gowned in
silks and satins. Why do little girls throw
crackers to swans in the parks?” This was entirely
beyond Buddie. “Because each one
thinks she may be doing a service to some
king’s son, who has been transformed by enchantment
into a swan, and who will reward
her by carrying her off to his father’s kingdom
in a golden chariot drawn by butterflies. Such
books, I say, are poison to a child’s mind; and
if I had my way I’d burn every one of them.”</p>

<p>“You shan’t burn mine,” declared Buddie,
stoutly.</p>

<p>“Well, go your way,” said the Stork, sadly.
“I wash my feet of you. If you come to a bad
end, don’t blame me.”</p>

<p>Buddie was not alarmed by the Stork’s
gloomy forebodings, but she was the least bit
disturbed by his denunciation of fairy tales and
picture-books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“What kind of books should little girls
have?” she asked soberly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_147.jpg" alt="Buddie and the Stork"></div>

<p>“Blank books,” was the reply. “They contain
nothing one should not know, and they
prove—I am speaking of blank books which are
ruled—two things every
one should know: that
a straight line is the
shortest distance between
two points, and
that parallel lines never
meet.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
own books,” decided Buddie, after a little
reflection.</p>

<p>“Go your way,” the Stork said again; and
this time Buddie acted on the hint.</p>

<p>“I think I shall,” she said, rising. “Good-by!”</p>

<p>“Good-by!” said the Stork, not unpleasantly,
and resumed his gymnastics.</p>

<p>Buddie turned once or twice to watch him,
but he did not seem to be getting on a bit
well.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he will never look like <i>four</i>,”
she thought. “He’s so stupid.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>AT THE CORNER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Buddie had walked a long way from the
Stork before it occurred to her that she had
forgotten to inquire of him the way to the
Corner: it was just possible he knew. But it
was too far to go back; so she kept on in the
hope of coming to the Corner or some path
leading to it. This hope was soon realized.
A very plain opening in the wall of fir-trees
disclosed itself, and another sign-board gave
information that <i>this</i> was the way to the Corner.
Strange she had not noticed it when she
passed that way a little while before!</p>

<p>It proved a pleasant path to follow, especially
after it drew away from the swamp and
began to climb a little ridge. The Christmas
trees gave place to birches and poplars, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
sweet-smelling Canada balsam, and other trees
that prefer hard ground to swamp land; a
white-throated sparrow, which seemed to be
traveling Buddie’s way, sang every minute or
two his happy little song; and a brook, which
was traveling the other way, gurgled something
that sounded like: “What’s the use of going
uphill when it is so much pleasanter to go
down?”</p>

<p>But Buddie had not much farther to go.
There was one steep little hill to climb, and a
huge fallen tree to get over, but, these passed,
her journey was at an end. On a big pine-tree
was a fourth sign-board which read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p>THIS IS THE CORNER</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>“What a perfectly ’diculous corner!” cried
Buddie, disappointed because, so far as she
could see, it did not differ from any other part
of the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Nothing in the wood, Little One, is harder
to find than a corner. And if you don’t know
one when you see it, you shall never find it.
There was a sign-board to tell Buddie, but I
never heard of anybody else being assisted in
that way.</p>

<p>Little as there was to see at the Corner, Buddie
had no opportunity to look about. The patter
of feet sounded close at hand, and the Rabbit
made his appearance. He was equipped for
a journey, and evidently no short one; on his
back was a large pack—that is, large for a
rabbit.</p>

<p>“On time to a minute,” he said, referring
to himself. “Have you been waiting long?”</p>

<p>“I just came,” answered Buddie. “Is it far
to the Greenwood Club?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; only a little way. We can follow
this path or take a short cut through the brush,
as you prefer.”</p>

<p>Buddie thought the path would be more
agreeable, and they moved along, the Rabbit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
chatting pleasantly about the weather, which
was remarkably fine, even for that time of year,
but making no reference to the birthday party
at the Bear’s and the strange way it broke up.</p>

<p>Yes; he was going on a journey later in the
day, after the frolic at the Greenwood Club.
He was going up to The Well, as he had informed
her when first she met him. Where
was this wonderful Well? The Rabbit could
not say; he had never been there. Then how
did he expect to find it? He had a map, which
he showed Buddie.</p>

<p>“My grandfather made it,” said he. “He
went up to The Well five years ago.”</p>

<p>“To find out why a rabbit wabbles his
nose?” The Rabbit nodded. “Did he find
out?” The Rabbit shook his head.</p>

<p>“The water was too high; he couldn’t get
near the mouth of The Well.”</p>

<p>“Why, what a funny map!” cried Buddie.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with it?” demanded the
Rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Buddie did not undertake to say right off.
She had seen a great many maps. Every
land-looker that stopped at the log house for a
chat or a dinner had a pocketful of them, and
many an expedition into the timber had been
planned within Buddie’s hearing. All these
maps were ruled off into little squares, in which
were indicated the rivers, swamps, hills and
trails—when there were any trails, which
wasn’t often. But the Rabbit’s map—well, if
you will glance at the next page you will see
just how it looked.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with it?” the Rabbit again
demanded, and in a slightly offended tone.</p>

<p>“It may be all right,” Buddie hastened to
say; “only, you know, it’s nothing but circles.”</p>

<p>“When you walk in the wood where there
aren’t any paths you keep going round in a
circle, don’t you?” said the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Do I?” said Buddie, wonderingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowe20" id="i_154">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_154.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><i>THE RABBIT’S MAP</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Of course you do,” said the Rabbit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
“Now, it stands to reason that if you begin by
making a large circle, then a second circle
smaller than the first, then a third smaller than
the second, and so on, you will eventually come
to what you are looking for.”</p>

<p>This sounded plausible.</p>

<p>“But,” said Buddie, “you don’t need a
map for <i>that</i>, do you?”</p>

<p>“My grandfather was a great hand for
maps,” replied the Rabbit. “He used to say:
Never start to explore a strange country without
first making a map of it.”</p>

<p>“It seems a dreadfully roundabout way,”
objected Buddie, with another glance at the
circles.</p>

<p>The argument was interrupted by the sound
of snapping twigs, and Buddie looked up to see
the long ears of the Donkey through the network
of green. He, too, was on his way to the
Greenwood Club, and he expressed pleasure at
again meeting Buddie and the Rabbit; but, like
the Rabbit, he made no reference to the Bear’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
party and its curious ending. Perhaps the people
of the wood took such things quite as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>“Are you estimating timber?” asked the
Donkey, with a glance at the Rabbit’s pack.</p>

<p>“I am going up to The Well to find out why
I wabble my nose,” the Rabbit replied.</p>

<p>“He has a map,” said Buddie, curious to
know what the Donkey thought of it. “Show
it to the Professor.”</p>

<p>The Rabbit passed it over, and the Donkey,
after one look, hee-hawed outrageously.</p>

<p>“Thistles and cactus!” he cried. “This isn’t
a map; it’s a target.”</p>

<p>“It’s a map, and a perfectly good one,” said
the Rabbit, highly offended by the ridicule.
“My grandfather made it.”</p>

<p>“Your grandfather must have been a Welsh
rabbit, and dreamed it,” said the Donkey, with
a chuckle.</p>

<p>“He was <i>not</i> a Welsh rabbit, and he did <i>not</i>
dream it,” returned the Rabbit, now furious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Then he must have had wheels in his
head,” declared the Donkey. “Thistles and
cactus! Where do you expect to get to with
such a map?”</p>

<p>As the Rabbit was too angry to reply, Buddie
repeated his explanation about traveling in
gradually narrowing circles.</p>

<p>“Bosh!” cried the Donkey. “Why, it would
take you a week.”</p>

<p>“I expect to be gone a week,” said the Rabbit,
coldly.</p>

<p>“But what’s the use of spending a week on
a journey you can do in an hour?” said the
Donkey. “Come, be reasonable.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if you are so clever, you can show
me the way,” said the Rabbit, who believed
the Donkey was talking simply to hear himself
talk.</p>

<p>“I certainly can,” replied the other, amiably.
“But we’ll talk about this later. Here
we are at the Club now, and it’s about time for
the fun to begin.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>A FROLIC IN THE FOREST</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The grounds of the Greenwood Club were
situated in and about a natural clearing on the
edge of a grove of pine-trees. Here, once a
week, as the Rabbit had said, the wood people
gathered for a session of play and talk, their
minds free from the cares of every-day life.</p>

<p>“We have the games and races first, and
the literary exercises afterward,” the Rabbit
informed Buddie. “Not many go to the lecture.
Doctor Goose is rather dry.”</p>

<p>Now they had entered the amphitheater
which formed what might be called the main
club-room, and, glancing around, Buddie saw
nearly all her wood friends and many she had
yet to know.</p>

<p>“I declare, there’s Colonel!” she exclaimed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
“I suppose the Laziest Beaver was too lazy to
come; I don’t see him anywhere. And I’m
glad Colonel has finished that tiresome old
song; and I hope he isn’t put out because I
didn’t stay to listen to it. It wasn’t my fault.”</p>

<p>If the Yellow Dog was put out he exhibited
no signs of annoyance. He smiled pleasantly
as Buddie came up, and held out a paw in his
best manner.</p>

<p>“Who’s your friend with the long ears?” he
asked in an undertone.</p>

<p>“They both have long ears,” replied Buddie,
looking from the Rabbit to the Donkey. “But
I suppose you mean Professor Bray. He’s
dreadfully wise. He’s been everywhere and
knows everything and everybody.”</p>

<p>“Present me,” requested Colonel; and Buddie
contrived to do so, after a fashion; “presenting”
people was a new experience.</p>

<p>“What war were you in, Colonel?” asked
the Donkey, affably.</p>

<p>“No war of any account,” replied the Yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Dog, “unless you would call a brush with Indians—”</p>

<p>“Sufficient to justify the title? Certainly. I
served six months in South Africa and was decorated—”</p>

<p>Buddie did not wait to hear the repetition of
the story. At the Rabbit’s suggestion she
moved along and made the acquaintance of various
members of the Club.</p>

<p>There was a Reticent Magpie, who never
spoke unless he was spoken to, and whose only
replies were Yes and No; a Refined Pig, who
never grunted, and who would walk miles out
of his way to avoid mud or bog land; an Improvident
Squirrel, who never laid by nuts for a
rainy or wintry day, and was continually borrowing
supplies of his neighbor, a Prosperous
Churchmouse, who was so fat that he could
barely waddle; a Bat, who could see for miles,
and who always officiated as judge in the club
races; a Hen with the toothache, and a number
of others of more or less account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_161.jpg" alt="The Golf Lynx"></div>

<p>One animal in particular attracted Buddie’s
attention. He wore gay plaids and a funny
little cap, and he carried a stick with which he
knocked a small ball from one end of the clearing
to the other. First he placed the ball on a
tuft of grass; then he swung the stick over his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
shoulder and shouted “Fore!” and then he
whacked at the ball, sometimes hitting it and
sometimes not.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” Buddie asked.</p>

<p>“He’s the Golf Lynx,” replied the Rabbit,
“and he’s a great nuisance, for he’s always
hitting somebody with the ball, and it hurts, I
can tell you. Doctor Goose says the poor fellow
can’t help it, as—”</p>

<p>“Fore!” shouted a voice close at hand, and
a ball whizzed by within an inch of Buddie’s
ear.</p>

<p>“The games are beginning!” cried another
voice, and everybody began to move toward
one end of the clearing, where the ground
pitched up and formed a sort of grandstand.</p>

<p>“You must excuse me for a while,” said the
Rabbit to Buddie, as they fell in with the procession.
“My race with the tortoise comes
first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you fall asleep and wait for him to
come poking along?” asked Buddie, her mind
on the old fable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“No, indeed,” replied the Rabbit. “We’re
pretty evenly matched. First he wins, and
then I win. It’s my turn this week. On a
straight line I could beat him every time; but,
as I explained to you this morning, I have to
do a great deal of zigzagging.”</p>

<p>When every one had found a seat Doctor
Fox announced that the Club’s distinguished
Visitor, Professor Bray, had kindly requested
to act as master of ceremonies, and a great
cheer went up.</p>

<p>The race between the Tortoise and the Rabbit
was quickly run. They got away in a pretty
start, and it was nip and tuck to the other end
of the clearing. As it was some distance
across the open, Buddie could not see who was
ahead at the finish; but the Bat announced
that the Rabbit had won by an ear.</p>

<p>“That’s the advantage of having long ears,”
remarked the Yellow Dog, who sat next to
Buddie.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how the Tortoise manages it,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
said she. “It’s wonderful the way he gets over
the ground.”</p>

<p>“He’s a high-geared tortoise—the fastest
one in the wood,” said the Yellow Dog.
“Hello! here comes the Bear with the Weasel.
Now we’ll have some fun.”</p>

<p>Out of the brush near the grandstand came
the Great Huge Bear, rolling a furry object over
and over with his paws.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the Weasel?”
Buddie asked. “Can’t he walk?”</p>

<p>“He’s asleep,” replied Colonel. “He’s
always asleep. You know the old saying: You
can’t catch a weasel awake. Come along and
help toss him.”</p>

<p>Buddie followed the others, and presently
found herself holding one corner of a blanket,
upon which the Weasel had been rolled. Then
the jolly party began to skip around in a circle,
singing—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Impty, mimpty, jiggety-jig,</div>
<div class="indent">Ibbity, bibbity, beazle,</div>
<div class="verse">Timty, tumty, tibbity-fig,</div>
<div class="indent">Pop! goes the Weasel.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>At the word “Pop!” the weasel was tossed
high in the air; and as he sailed skyward he
half awoke and made a sound like a cork coming
out of a bottle. Before he began to descend
he was sound asleep again.</p>

<p>Round and round they skipped and sang,
until every one was tired and out of breath.</p>

<p>“If I could only sleep like that!” sighed the
Great Huge Bear, as he rolled the Weasel back
into the bushes.</p>

<p>The next event was an exhibition of bear-back
riding by the Stork. The Great Huge
Bear raced around the clearing as fast as he
could go, and tried in various ways to shake
the Stork off; but the bird finished the trip in
triumph, and caused a great sensation by balancing,
part of the time, on one leg. Buddie
was especially delighted by this unexpected
feat; for it was she that had suggested the
idea to the Stork. Next to the pleasure of being
able to do a thing oneself comes the pleasure
of suggesting it to some one else that can,
and thereby sharing in his success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Playing <i>’Possum</i>” was the next game on
the program.</p>

<p>“Choose partners!” called out the Donkey,
and the company, pairing off, formed a ring
around the ’Possum. “Change partners!”
called the Donkey, and a scramble followed.
“’Possum!” was the next call, and there was
another scramble, followed by a laugh at Buddie’s
expense. The ’Possum had seized a partner,
and Buddie was left without one. She
had been forced into the ’Possum’s place in the
center of the ring. It was something like “Old
Dan Tucker,” with the music and dancing
omitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_167.jpg" alt="The Stork bear-back riding"></div>

<p>Next came a bowling contest, open to all
members of the Club large enough to take
part. Ten chipmunks, sitting up straight and
stiff, served as pins, and the Fretless Porcupine
curled himself up for the ball. In the ordinary
bowling alley the ball must be rolled back in a
trough; but the Porcupine simply uncurled
himself after each throw, and trotted back for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
another. He seemed to enjoy the game as
much as the others, and the chipmunks didn’t
mind being pins, for they were seldom knocked
over, and when they were it didn’t hurt them a
bit.</p>

<p>While these sports were going on two teams
of bats were playing cricket, and the still
smaller members of the Club were playing
<i>Leapfrog</i>, <i>Worm i’ the Bud</i>, <i>Who Killed
Cock Robin?</i>, <i>Beetle, Beetle, Who’s Got the
Beetle?</i> and other games; and everybody was
having such a good time that very few heard
the Donkey announce that Doctor Goose’s lecture
was about to begin.</p>

<p>“Shall you stay for the lecture?” asked the
Rabbit, hurrying up to Buddie.</p>

<p>“I should like to hear part of it, at least,”
said she. “The Donkey is going to stay;
aren’t you, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the Donkey. “Some of
us should remain. The growth of letters should
be encouraged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“I like lettuce as well as any one,” said the
Rabbit; “but Doctor Goose never talks about
lettuce.”</p>

<p>The Donkey put on his most pitying smile.</p>

<p>“Life is not all eating and drinking,” said he.</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” returned the Rabbit; “but
I’d rather eat than hear one of Doctor Goose’s
lectures.”</p>

<p>“Philistine!” muttered the Donkey.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the Rabbit, suspiciously.</p>

<p>But the Donkey scorned to reply.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>DR. GOOSE’S LECTURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Light house,” said the Great Huge Bear;
after which remark he dropped off into another
of his half-naps.</p>

<p>The audience that gathered to hear Doctor
Goose was small indeed. There was Buddie,
who really wished to hear the lecture; the Donkey,
who would as soon hear it as not; the
Rabbit, who was present under protest; Doctor
Fox, wearing his most critical air, and prepared
to contradict every third statement; the Bear,
who would as soon be dozing there as elsewhere;
the Yellow Dog, who came out of
curiosity; and the Loon, who never missed a
chance to shriek “Hear! hear!”</p>

<p>“Birds and quadrupeds,” began Doctor
Goose, “my topic this week is The Evolution
of—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Fore!”</p>

<p>A ball driven by the Golf Lynx carried away
the Doctor’s manuscript.</p>

<p>“I’ll put a stop to that!” cried the Rabbit,
starting after the Golf Lynx. But the Lynx
saw him coming and discreetly took to his heels.
Meantime Buddie had recovered the scattered
manuscript, and Doctor Goose proceeded, as if
there had been no interruption:</p>

<p>“—the Man Story. It is impossible to fix
the date of the first man story, because we do
not know precisely at what time geese began to
write.”</p>

<p>“Literature,” interrupted Doctor Fox, “began
with the Fox family.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, my dear colleague,”
returned the lecturer, warmly. “Literature began
with the goose-quill.”</p>

<p>“I leave it,” said Doctor Fox, excitedly, “to
my learned friend, Professor Bray.”</p>

<p>The Donkey bowed.</p>

<p>“I have always believed,” he said, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
a donkey wrote the first book; I <i>know</i> he wrote
the last one. I regret to say that I am unacquainted
with any literature by the Fox family,
with the exception of the <i>Book of Martyrs</i>, a
most excellent work, as instructive, though not
so entertaining, as the rhymes of Mother Goose.
The first is the older, but the second is the
more popular.”</p>

<p>This decision was, as usual, agreeable to both
disputants, and Doctor Goose continued:</p>

<p>“At all events, it may safely be assumed that
the earliest man stories were merely records of
the chase. After a man had been pursued, captured
and eaten by a bear—”</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that?” asked the Great
Huge Bear, unclosing his eyes. “I never did
anything of the sort.”</p>

<p>“I was speaking of the old and savage days,”
replied Doctor Goose, and the Bear dozed off
again.</p>

<p>“After such a successful hunt, it was the custom
to relate the details, with more or less exaggeration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
to a circle of companions; and this
was the beginning of the man story. For centuries
these tales of the chase held their popularity;
but as reason superseded mere instinct
and animals advanced in civilization, they
hunted man less and studied him more. Gradually
they began to believe that this strange
creature, whose kind spread all over the world,
possessed reasoning faculties similar to their
own—he might even have a soul; and to-day it
is generally admitted that the line between the
lowest animals and the highest man is so fine as
scarcely to be discerned.”</p>

<p>At this point the Rabbit returned to announce,
with a little swagger, the complete
discomfiture of the Golf Lynx. Buddie was not
so sure of this; she could see the Lynx peeping
from behind a tree at the farther end of the
amphitheater; whereas, according to the Rabbit,
he should be “running yet.”</p>

<p>“That the average animal,” resumed Doctor
Goose, “is superior to the average man in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
the common virtues of cleanliness, orderliness,
straightforwardness, common sense, and capacity
for sane enjoyment, goes without saying.”</p>

<p>“Like a hickory nut,” remarked Doctor Fox.</p>

<p>“Why like a hickory nut?” asked Buddie.</p>

<p>“That’s a hard nut to crack,” replied Doctor
Fox, mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” shrieked the Loon; and
this time there was some sense in the usually
meaningless remark, as Doctor Goose was
waiting patiently for a chance to go on. If,
Little One, instead of interrupting a speaker,
people would cry “Hear! hear!” when a
speaker is interrupted, much time would be
saved; for then there would be no interruptions.</p>

<p>Buddie tried to keep interested in the lecture,
but her attention wandered to the Golf
Lynx, who had come out of hiding and was
again knocking the ball about the green.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose he can help it,” she
thought; “any more than Colonel can help
running after sticks and stones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Meanwhile Doctor Goose was droning
along:</p>

<p>“It is only in the purely intellectual field
that we have come to regard man as a present
equal and a possible superior.”</p>

<p>“I doubt that,” said Doctor Fox.</p>

<p>“Fore!”</p>

<p>This time the ball carried away the lecturer’s
spectacles, and confusion reigned. The Golf
Lynx took to his heels, and after him raced all
of Doctor Goose’s audience except Buddie,
who remained to help search for the spectacles.
But hunt high, hunt low, they were nowhere to
be found.</p>

<p>“Never mind; I can get another pair,” said
Doctor Goose. “Perhaps you’d like to take
the lecture home and read it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Buddie, accepting the
manuscript rather doubtfully. “Shan’t you
want it again?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no. I have stacks and stacks of
them. I write nearly all the time. But it is
<i>so</i> hard to get people to listen.” Doctor Goose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
sighed and looked about him pensively. The
world was at play; nobody cared about lectures.
“Good afternoon,” he said, and walked sadly
away.</p>

<p>“Poor Goose!” said Buddie, sitting down
under a tree to examine the manuscript.</p>

<p>“My, what hard words! I wonder what
they mean. ‘P-s-y-c-h-o-l-o-g-y.’ That can’t be
right; there ought to be a letter between the
‘p’ and the ‘s.’ ‘P-s’ doesn’t spell anything.
Here’s another big word—‘I-n-t-e-l-l-e-c-t-u-a-l-i-t-y.’
That looks all right, and I suppose
it means a lot.”</p>

<p>So she turned the pages of the manuscript,
which was as easy to read as print, until she
grew weary of spelling out words and wondering
what they meant, and began to look about
for something more interesting.</p>

<p>Presently she saw the Donkey, the Rabbit,
and the Yellow Dog returning from the pursuit
of the Golf Lynx.</p>

<p>“The next thing, I suppose,” she said, “is
to find out why the Rabbit wabbles his nose.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE WELL IN THE WOOD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>With his usual show of importance, the Donkey
took entire charge of the expedition to The
Well.</p>

<p>“To begin with,” said he, “we need a
guide.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” cried the Rabbit. “I thought <i>you</i>
knew the way.”</p>

<p>“We need a guide,” repeated the Donkey,
calmly, “not to show the way;—I’ll attend to
that,—but to tell stories; that’s what guides are
for. Now, then, whom can we get?”</p>

<p>“The ’Possum tells the best stories,” said
the Yellow Dog; “but he’s fat and he’s slow.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” said the Donkey.
“Go and hire him. And—stop a minute. Can
you get this check cashed for me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“I can try the Pine-Tree,” said Colonel.
“That’s the only bank around here.”</p>

<p>“Pine-Tree shillings are rather heavy, but
they’ll have to do,” said the Donkey. “In all
exploring expeditions,” he went on, as the
Yellow Dog departed on his errands, “the
question of funds is of first importance. And
now,”—to the Rabbit,—“in what direction is
The Well?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the Rabbit, a little
sulkily. “According to my map—”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Donkey. “According to
your <i>target</i> it’s north, east, south and west.
Shoot such a map! However, we’ll soon find
out.” He turned to Buddie. “Will you kindly
break off a branch from that witch-hazel bush?
Get the straightest one, and trim off the leaves
and twigs. There! Now stand it on end, and
when it is perfectly balanced take your hand
away.”</p>

<p>Buddie followed these directions, and when
she removed her hand the witch-hazel stick fell—it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
really seemed to jump—toward a big birch-tree
at one end of the amphitheater.</p>

<p>“There’s your direction,” said the Donkey.
“All you have to do now is to follow your
nose.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_179.jpg" alt="Buddie getting directions"></div>

<p>“That sounds easy,” said the Rabbit.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> easy—if your nose is straight,” said
the Donkey. “Of course there wouldn’t be
any use following such a wabbly nose as yours.
<i>I’ll</i> go ahead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>At this point the Yellow Dog returned
with the ’Possum and a bag of Pine-Tree shillings,
and the expedition set forward in the following
order: the Donkey, the Rabbit, Buddie,
the Yellow Dog, and the ’Possum.</p>

<p>“I wonder what direction we really are
going in,” Colonel remarked to Buddie.</p>

<p>“That’s easily found out,” said the Donkey,
whose long ears had caught the remark, “if
Just Buddie will wet her finger and hold it up
in the air.”</p>

<p>Buddie did so.</p>

<p>“One side’s colder than the other, isn’t it?”
asked the Donkey.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem so,” answered Buddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, it must be. Try again.”</p>

<p>So Buddie again wet her forefinger and held
it up, and a little puff of wind came along and
cooled the farther side of it.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said she; “it’s the side toward
you.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re traveling north, just as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
thought,” said the Donkey. “You will also
observe that the farther we go the flatter the
ground becomes. The earth, you know, flattens
at the poles—not all at once, but gradually.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he dreadfully wise!” Buddie whispered
to Colonel.</p>

<p>“He’s a wonder,” replied the Yellow Dog,
who hadn’t a bit of envy in his make-up, and
always gave credit where credit was due.</p>

<p>For some time the little party wound through
the wood in silence, the Donkey following his
nose, the others following him. Presently the
leader called a halt to wait for the guide, who
was some distance in the rear.</p>

<p>“Time for a story,” he announced, when
the ’Possum at last came lumbering along,
puffing at every step.</p>

<p>“What shall it be?” asked the guide, when
he could get breath enough to speak.</p>

<p>“A fairy story,” ventured Buddie.</p>

<p>“I don’t know any fairy stories,” said the
’Possum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“A good ghost story would suit me,” said
the Donkey.</p>

<p>“I never tell ghost stories by daylight,”
said the ’Possum.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, give us anything, only be quick
about it,” said the Rabbit, who was impatient
for the journey’s end.</p>

<p>“Last summer,” began the guide, “I was
fishing for trout in the headwaters of Flute
River.”</p>

<p>A long pause.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the Yellow Dog.</p>

<p>“It weighed six pounds,” finished the guide.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to tell a story,” said the
Donkey, rising. “Skip the details and get at
the important facts. Forward! March!”</p>

<p>They resumed their journey, and before long
the sound of falling waters came to their ears.</p>

<p>“We’re getting there,” remarked the Donkey,
complacently. “This beats traveling on
the rings of a target.”</p>

<p>To this fling the Rabbit made no reply. Probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
he did not hear it. His thoughts were of
his precious nose. At last, fortune favoring,
he was to unravel the great mystery of his existence.
Now or never should he find out why
he wabbled his nose. Trembling with excitement,
he bounded ahead, and when the others
came up to The Well, they found him leaning
over the curb staring into the dark interior.</p>

<p>The Well was picturesquely located on a
sloping ledge which formed one bank of the
river, at the foot of a tinkling cascade. Swirling
stones in floodtime had made it—had bored
down through the solid rock as neatly as a diamond
drill could do the work. I have seen a
great many of these wells, but none exactly like
the one Buddie described to me; for this had a
curb around it, and above it, supported by two
posts, was the legend:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p>As round as an apple, as deep as a cup,<br>
And all the king’s horses can’t pull it up.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Well, here we are,” said the Donkey to
the Rabbit. “Go ahead and find out why you
wabble your nose. I confess I am rather curious
to know.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the Rabbit, nervously,
“we’d better ask about the Guinea-Pig first. He
isn’t here, but some one can inquire for him.”</p>

<p>“What does the Guinea-Pig want to know?”
asked the Donkey, who never had met that
tearful little creature.</p>

<p>“He wants to know why his eyes fall out
when you hold him up by the tail,” the Rabbit
replied.</p>

<p>“For that matter,” said Colonel, “I should
like to know why a yellow dog isn’t considered
as respectable as a dog of any other color.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said the ’Possum, “should like to
know why I dislike the taste of persimmons and
can’t eat ’em.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said the Donkey, “should like to
find out the best singing method. How about
Just Buddie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Nothing—that is, nothing I think of just
now,” she replied hastily.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you ask for the rest of us,”
said the Donkey. “All in favor of Just Buddie’s
asking all the questions will say ‘Aye’; contrary-minded,
‘No.’ The ayes appear to have
it. Motion carried unanimously.”</p>

<p>“Which shall I ask first?” said Buddie, as
she knelt at the curb and the others gathered
about her.</p>

<p>“Oh, ask about the Rabbit,” said the Donkey.
“Let’s get that off our minds. Lean
over as far as you can, and holler at the top of
your voice. It may be a long way to the
bottom.”</p>

<p>Clutching the curb tightly with both hands,
Buddie bent over as far as she dared. As she
did so something passed before her eyes.</p>

<p>It was the long-forgotten bouquet of Enchanter’s
Nightshade, which had worked loose
from her hair-ribbon, and now vanished in the
depths of The Well.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>DISENCHANTMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<i>Why does a rabbit wabble his nose?</i>”</p>

<p>Not even Echo replied.</p>

<p>Buddie waited a little while, her ears strained
for the slightest whisper in response; but, none
coming, she shouted the question a second
time.</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Truth isn’t at home to-day,”
said Buddie, getting up from her knees. “Why,
where have they gone?”</p>

<p>Not a soul was in sight. She was again
alone in the wood.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I didn’t look up this time,” she
said, perplexed and grieved by the disappearance
of her friends. “And—what’s become of
The Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>The curb, the posts and the legend they supported
had also vanished. All that remained
was the cylinder-bore in the solid rock.</p>

<p>For the first time that day Buddie began to
feel frightened. The cascade no longer tinkled;
it thundered. The wild river, stained with the
juices of burnt land and swamp land, its dark
breast flecked with the foam of countless falls
and rapids, rushed by within a foot or two of
where she stood, and the ledge trembled under
the mighty blows of the plunging torrent.
White arms seemed to reach up from the pool
to draw her into the black water, and the flying
spray wet her face. Terrified, she ran back
among the trees, threw herself on the mossy
floor of the wood, and hid her face in her arms.</p>

<p>Thus she had lain for some minutes, a dreadful
fear tightening around her little heart, when
suddenly a familiar sound brought her scrambling
to her feet. It was Colonel’s bark; but it
seemed a long way off, across the river. As it
was not instantly repeated she began to fear she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
had heard it only in imagination; but presently
the cheerful voice of the faithful Yellow Dog
sounded again above the roar of the falls, and
Buddie ran down to the river, calling “Colonel!
Colonel!”</p>

<p>An especially happy yelp answered her, and
the Yellow Dog burst through the brush on the
river’s farther bank. But instead of crossing on
the boulders, which were conveniently disposed
for a bridge, he ran back into the wood. He
was out again in a moment, wagging his tail
and barking joyously, as much as to say:
“Here she is! Could any black or brown dog
have done better?”</p>

<p>Back he flung into the brush, and when next
he appeared a man came with him. Buddie
recognized Mr. Goodell, a land-looker who frequently
stopped at the log house by the lake.</p>

<p>“Hello; Buddie!” called the land-looker, in
his big good-natured voice. “Don’t stand so
near the water, little girl, or you’ll tumble in.
Good dog!”—patting Colonel, who was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
frantic with delight and cleared the stream in
two bounds.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodell made the passage more carefully.
A slip meant a ducking, if nothing
worse.</p>

<p>“So you paddled into the woods and got
lost, eh?” remarked the land-looker, unswinging
his pack from his back and proceeding to
fill his pipe. “Seem’s if I’ve heard your ma
say something about that sort o’ thing.”</p>

<p>“But the bears didn’t eat me up,” said Buddie,
recalling her mother’s familiar warning.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess there ain’t many bear about
here,” said the land-looker with a smile.</p>

<p>“I saw three,” said Buddie, eagerly: “the
Great Hooge Bear, the Middle Bear, and the
Little Small Wee Bear.”</p>

<p>“So!” said Mr. Goodell, seriously.</p>

<p>“And a Beaver, and a Rabbit, and a Guinea-Pig,
and a Loon, and a Fox, and a Goose, and
a Donkey—” Buddie went on, rapidly enumerating
her acquaintances of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>The lighted match fell from the land-looker’s
hand.</p>

<p>“A donkey!” he repeated. Then he smiled,
and struck another match, and for a few moments
smoked in silence.</p>

<p>“And we had <i>such</i> a good time at the Greenwood
Club,” said Buddie. “The Rabbit and
the Tortoise ran a race, and we tossed the Weasel
in a blanket, and Doctor Goose read a paper
and—oh, dear! I can’t begin to think of all
the things we did. And, oh yes, we came up
to The Well to find out why the Rabbit wabbles
his nose. Didn’t we, Colonel?”</p>

<p>The Yellow Dog barked.</p>

<p>“I guess, little girl, you fell asleep and
dreamed all this,” remarked the land-looker,
eying her curiously.</p>

<p>“No; I didn’t,” declared Buddie, positively.
“It was <i>really</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell me all about it,” said Mr. Goodell,
with another indulgent smile. And Buddie,
beginning at the beginning, which is always the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
best place to begin, gave him a faithful account
of the day’s doings.</p>

<p>The land-looker listened gravely, and when
the story was done he rose and swung his pack
upon his back.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s room for you to ride,” said
he, hoisting Buddie to his shoulder. “We
must get home before your folks begin to
worry.”</p>

<p>So they set off for home, the Yellow Dog
trotting contentedly behind.</p>

<p>“You must sing your song for Mr. Goodell,
Colonel!” Buddie called back to him.</p>

<p>But the Yellow Dog only barked. And from
that day to this Buddie has never been able to
get a word out of him concerning their remarkable
adventures.</p>
